<span class="fs80">STARTING FOR CHERRY BLOSSOM MINE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“So-long, boys! We’ll look for you back in
ten days or two weeks, Frank!”</p>

<p>“Sure, dad; but don’t worry if we fail to show
up by then. Something might happen to detain
us at the mine, you know!”</p>

<p>“Send word, if you can, son. I suppose I
ought to go with you myself; but that game leg
still troubles me on a long ride. Besides, you and
Bob have done so well lately, that I think it would
be safe to trust anything in your hands.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to do the best we can to get the
tangle ironed out at the mine, whatever it proves
to be; and have matters running smooth again.
Good-by, Bart Heminway! All kinds of good
luck with you on the range while we’re away.
So-long boys! Wish the whole bunch of you
could gallop with us! Ready, Bob? Then
we’re off!”</p>

<p>A series of parting salutes, such as only wide-awake
cowboys know how to give, followed
Frank and his chum as they galloped away from
the Circle Ranch cattle corral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>Frank’s father, the owner of the place, sat
stride his big roan, and surrounded by his dozen
tried and true “punchers” watched his boy
Frank, accompanied by his comrade, Bob Archer,
from Kentucky, as they topped a slight rise of the
prairie about half a mile away.</p>

<p>“One last shout, and then we lose sight of the
old ranch house!” said Frank.</p>

<p>They turned in the saddle, and waved their hats
three times, accompanying each movement with a
clear call that brought an answering whoop from
the little cluster of horsemen.</p>

<p>Then the word was given, and the eager, mettlesome
horses sprang down the easy descent.
The distant white-washed buildings, that constituted
the heart of the famous Circle Ranch in
Arizona, disappeared from sight. Before the
two boys lay the great level plains, with the
mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>Frank had been brought up amid such surroundings,
and was fairly well versed in such things
as went with life on a big cattle ranch. He was
never so happy as when mounted on his sturdy
and swift pony, “Buckskin,” and galloping over
the country, either pursuing some of the duties of
a cow puncher, or hunting such game as might be
found within a radius of twenty miles.</p>

<p>Frank was a athletic fellow, as might be expected
of one who spent so much time on horseback.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
His clear blue eyes gleamed fearlessly,
and he had proved this trait of his character on
numerous occasions.</p>

<p>Bob Archer, his chum, had until recently lived
in Kentucky, where he attended a military academy
at Frankfort. His father having entered
into partnership with Colonel Haywood in several
mining ventures, the old home had been left
behind for a new life in Arizona.</p>

<p>These two lads had early taken a great fancy
to one another. Of course when Bob first came
to the cattle country he was a real “tenderfoot;”
but experience was fast taking that title away.
Indeed, the boys of Circle Ranch declared that it
was seldom a “greenhorn” picked up so quickly
a knowledge of the thousand-and-one things essential
to the genuine cowboy.</p>

<p>He had brought a black horse from his Kentucky
home; and this same Domino had often
proved that he could run a mile faster than the
smaller Buckskin; but when it came to an all-day
gallop, the animal Frank bestrode was apt to
show up better as a “stayer.”</p>

<p>Not a great while before this, the boys had
passed through a series of stirring adventures
while investigating a mystery that had awed the
Indians for perhaps fully a century. A mountain
within a day’s ride of the ranch often gave
vent to strange sounds that were likened to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
growl of heavy thunder. What it turned out to
be, and how the boys solved the puzzle, is contained
in the first volume of this series, called
“The Saddle Boys in the Rockies; or, Lost On
Thunder Mountain.”</p>

<p>It was shortly after their return to the ranch
that a remarkable thing happened when a message
that had been found in a sealed bottle floating
in the current of the Lower Colorado River
was brought to Colonel Haywood, at a time when
he happened to be laid up with a broken leg.</p>

<p>If you think you would like to learn how Frank
and Bob took the place of the ranchman, going on
horseback to the world-famous Grand Canyon
of the Colorado in answer to the call that had
reached them, together with what remarkable
things happened to them while there, read the
second volume in this series, entitled, “The Saddle
Boys in the Grand Canyon; or, The Hermit
of Echo Cave.”</p>

<p>And now the lads were once again starting out
on a long gallop that would take them far to the
south, into the mining country within a day’s ride
of the Mexican border. Here was located the
most valuable of all the gold-producing properties
controlled by Colonel Haywood and Mr. Archer,
known as the Cherry Blossom Mine.</p>

<p>Word had been brought to the colonel that
there seemed to be trouble brewing at the mine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
The message had given no particulars, nor was it
signed with any name. It simply stated that if
he were wise, and wished to nip trouble in the
bud, he would better take a horse and run down
to investigate, before matters reached a crisis.</p>

<p>But as Mr. Archer was East, looking after the
marketing of certain stock in Wall Street, and
Colonel Haywood’s broken leg had hardly healed
enough for him to attempt a ride of several days,
the ranchman found himself once more compelled
to throw the burden on the shoulders of his only
son Frank, and the latter’s chum, Bob Archer.</p>

<p>Armed with all manner of instructions, and
legal documents to prove their authority as the
representatives of the parties holding a controlling
interest in the wonderfully productive Cherry
Blossom, the two chums were now heading into
the hazy South. What lay beyond no one could
even guess; but both seemed to “feel in their
bones,” as Bob expressed it, that new and
surprising adventures were in store for them
among the plains and mountains of Southern
Arizona.</p>

<p>And so they started out that fine morning, with
high anticipations. In the bracing air the two
horses vied with each other in covering the
ground; though Frank constantly advised his
comrade to hold Domino in.</p>

<p>“Out here, you see, Bob,” he would remark,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
“Where the horses are used to making a ten-hour
run; and then going at it again after a little rest,
when a stampede happens along, we learn the
value of holding a willing pony in early in the day.
It means better work later in the run. He
gradually gets down to business; just as you’ve
seen engines do in making a slow start.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I understand all that, Frank, because
you’ve told me lots of times; but then Domino
doesn’t seem to get on to it,” Bob replied, with a
laugh. “He pulls as if he belonged to a fire engine,
and had heard the alarm. Hold up there,
you Blue-Grass exile; before the day is done you’ll
have all the exercise you want, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“There’s a fine bunch of our cattle grazing
down by the stream yonder,” remarked Frank,
pointing with the quirt which was fastened to his
left wrist, cowboy fashion.</p>

<p>“And this is about as far as they’re allowed to
roam, isn’t it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, some of the boys have been keeping
watch on this lot all night,” Frank replied. “See,
there’s a fellow now, waving his hat, and whooping
at us. That must be Chesty Lane. Say, you
can just depend on it he’s feeling some bad that
he can’t ride with us. Chesty is always hungry
for something to happen. When things run too
smooth he just has to get away, and look for excitement
somehow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>“It was down through that rocky coulie that
last pack of wolves crept, when they played such
hob with the calves, wasn’t it?” Bob inquired,
after they had answered the wild cheers of the
“puncher” who was serving as guardian to the
herd.</p>

<p>“Yep!” said Frank. “But the chase was
swift, and not a single one of the pack ever got
away. I knocked over a hairy thief myself, and
that’s the skin on the floor of my room. It’s
nearly as big as the pelt you got, when we tracked
old Sallie and her whelps to their den, and you
shot her.”</p>

<p>“Wolves are getting scarce around here,
Frank, what with the ranchmen offering bounties
for every scalp, besides what the state pays!”</p>

<p>“Oh! there are always a few coming down
from the mountains,” replied the other. “Up
there they have breeding places where no man
can ever find ’em. But we have no cause to complain
about wolves nowadays. It’s the rustlers
that bother us most.”</p>

<p>“That crowd under the Mexican, Pedro Mendoza,
you mean,” Bob went on.</p>

<p>“Yes, they have some secret hiding place that
as yet has never been discovered. Some believe
they come all the way up from Mexico, but my
dad never would take to that idea. And he declares
that the next time any of the Circle cattle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
are driven off, he’s going to camp on the trail of
the thieves, and keep on following them if it
takes him down to Chihuahua.”</p>

<p>Frank himself looked quite grim as he said this.
Evidently he was of the same mind as his father,
the rancher.</p>

<p>When two hours had passed, and they had
placed a good many miles between themselves and
the ranch house that lay far to the north, Frank
drew up his horse.</p>

<p>“Better let ’em take a breathing spell,” he remarked.
“And you notice, now, that your black
doesn’t seem quite so eager to rush things.”</p>

<p>“I knew he would get over it,” laughed Bob,
as he patted the shiny flank of his mount. “But
what lies away yonder toward the Southwest?”</p>

<p>“That’s the Arrowhead Ranch buildings, with
a grove of timber about them,” Frank replied.
“You know they’ve got a fine stream of water
there, that comes down from the mountains.
Father tried to buy that ranch, but some one else
had the option. I’m afraid it’s going to drop
into the hands of the Syndicate that is gobbling up
all the good properties around here.”</p>

<p>“You mean the crowd of Eastern capitalists,
headed by the father of Peg Grant, the fellow
we had the trouble with on Thunder Mountain?”
Bob went on.</p>

<p>“Yes, the same bunch,” Frank continued.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
“They have it in for dad, I’m afraid, just because
he chooses to run his own business in his own
way, and refuses to throw in with the Syndicate.”</p>

<p>“You won’t go over to the Arrowhead, then?”
Bob asked.</p>

<p>“Not to-day. I’ve been there lots of time,
though. One of our boys got in a peck of trouble
with some of their punchers a short time ago; and
just now there’s bad blood between us. Come on,
and we’ll hit out for the hills some miles off.”</p>

<p>Frank gave Buckskin the signal with his heels,
and away the two horses flew over the level.</p>

<p>On reaching the hilly country Frank struck into
a trail leading through a district that was
rapidly growing wilder as they advanced; though
after a while they might again strike out on the
open country.</p>

<p>There were times when the trail itself was so
narrow that Bob fell in behind, and they moved
along in single file, the horses climbing the rise
gallantly.</p>

<p>Frank had his eyes ahead. He fancied that he
had detected some slight movement at a turn
about fifty yards beyond the spot they had now
reached.</p>

<p>“Hold up a minute, Bob!” he exclaimed, holding
out his hand in the manner understood by
every rider of the plains.</p>

<p>Just as he spoke he heard a strange “swishing”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
sound close by. Involuntarily Frank
ducked his head. Brought up amid such surroundings,
his ear was in tune with all things connected
with range life; and in this hissing sound
he knew that he had caught the whirl of a lariat
through the air. Just as he turned in his saddle,
he heard from his chum a half-muffled cry that
thrilled him.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SUDDEN ALARM</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When he turned so hastily, the astonished
Frank was just in time to see his chum topple from
his saddle, and fall heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>Domino, the black Kentucky horse, began
plunging wildly; but, fortunately, Bob’s feet were
free from the stirrups, so there was no danger of
his being dragged, should the mettlesome horse
bolt.</p>

<p>A series of yells broke forth from the rocks
and bushes just above the road. It was from
that point that the rope had been thrown which
had caught Bob so neatly, and unseated him.</p>

<p>Filled with the greatest alarm, and half fancying
that they had been waylaid by some Indians
off their reservation, Frank was trying to get hold
of his rifle, which he carried fastened to his back.</p>

<p>Buckskin, too, was prancing as though excited;
and it was no easy task to keep half a grip on the
bridle, and at the same time manage the gun.</p>

<p>Frank saw that Bob had scrambled to his knees,
and was holding on to the loop of the lariat which
he had snatched from around his shoulders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
There had been some resistance at first; but apparently
those behind the bushes feared what was
likely to happen once Frank succeeded in getting
his rifle free, for abandoning the rope they fled
with a new series of howls.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you shoot, Frank?” cried Bob,
considerably ruffled by his hard fall, and unable
to understand what it all meant.</p>

<p>“I’ve got half a mind to; the cowardly curs, to
play such a mean trick on us, and then vamoose
like snakes!” gritted Frank, raising his gun once
or twice, and aiming in the direction where the
shouts and wild laughter still continued, though
gradually growing fainter.</p>

<p>He could see several figures jumping over obstacles,
and trying to take advantage of every
little bit of cover that cropped up. And they
were neither Navajo Indians, as he had at first
suspected, nor the rustlers who were in the mind
of his chum.</p>

<p>“A trick, was it?” ejaculated Bob, feeling ruefully
of his knees, where he had come in contact
with the earth on falling. “Then they didn’t
mean to steal our horses, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Not quite so bad as that,” returned the other;
“but I wouldn’t put it past Peg Grant and his
bullies to do even a job of horse stealing if they
keep on the way they’re going.”</p>

<p>Bob uttered an angry snort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>“And was it that crowd pulled me off my horse
with a bump?” he exclaimed, as his face turned
a shade darker with indignation. “Then I’ll
have it out with Peg the first time I happen to
meet him.”</p>

<p>“There they go now, streaking it across that
open place; so I reckon they must have their
horses somewhere over in that region. Watch
me give the cowards a little scare!”</p>

<p>As Frank spoke he leveled his rifle in the direction
indicated. A shrill yelp of alarm must have
told the four runners what was threatening, for
instantly they threw themselves upon the ground,
and commenced rolling over and over, as if in the
hope of distracting the aim of the boy who sat
astride his buckskin horse, and kept his weapon
directed toward them.</p>

<p>Even Bob, who was engaged in rubbing his lame
knees and elbows, could not refrain from indulging
in a loud laugh, which must have reached the
ears of the panic-stricken quartette. One succeeded
in gaining the shelter of an outlying rock;
but the others rolled, and turned head over heels
in their desperate break for cover.</p>

<p>“All down in that alley!” sang out Bob, who
was rapidly recovering his customary genial disposition,
that had been sadly disturbed by the
abruptness of his tumble, and the ridiculous
nature of his adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“And they bit off more than they could chew,”
remarked Frank, as he once more slung his rifle
over his shoulder. “They expected to have a
heap of fun dragging you around; but I reckon
Peg got cold feet just as soon as he made the cast,
and saw me grabbing for my gun. When he lit
out, the rest trailed behind. Oh! they’re a sweet
bunch, all right.”</p>

<p>“Say, do you really think it was Peg who threw
that rope?” asked Bob, as he picked up the article
in question, and examined it.</p>

<p>“I sure do,” replied his chum. “It was as
easy a throw as anybody could try for a starter.
I heard how Peg was practicing early and late to
use a rope. He had that Nick Jennings coaching
him, too. Chances are they saw us coming, and
Peg, he ups and declares that he could yank one
of us off our saddles while we passed. So they
hid right here, and made the try.”</p>

<p>“Well, it might have been worse,” grunted
Bob, as he coiled the rope up again. “What if
my foot had got caught in the stirrup, and Domino
had bolted? Whew! that’s my first experience at
being roped. I don’t like it even a little bit.
There they go on their horses, Frank; and see
how they act! That’s a fine way to slope like
mad, isn’t it, and then pretend to be so bold?
Bah!”</p>

<p>“We’re in a good rope, if you care to look at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
it that way; also some experience,” Frank remarked,
with a suggestive smile at his chum.</p>

<p>“Likewise a few bruises, that will feel sore
the whole week,” added Bob, ruefully.</p>

<p>By this time Domino had stopped prancing
around, and allowed his master to once more secure
hold of the bridle. They were soon riding
along the trail again, just as though nothing out
of the way had happened.</p>

<p>“What d’ye suppose Peg Grant and that bunch
could have been doing over here?” Bob asked
after a time, as though he himself might have been
trying to figure things out, but without success.</p>

<p>“Oh! the country is free to anybody who cares
to ride,” laughed Frank. “Some go in for hunting;
others to taking long gallops; while a few like
to hover around, and pick up points concerning
rival ranches. You know we heard that the
Syndicate has an eye on the Arrowhead Ranch.
Perhaps Peg may have been sent out to get tabs
on the cattle they control, so the count-in won’t
be a fraud. Men who cheat are always expecting
others to try and get them in a dicker.”</p>

<p>“They thought you would sure shoot,”
chuckled Bob; “I never saw such ducking in all
my life. And that looked like Peg himself, the
one who smashed into that tree.”</p>

<p>“It was a sweet bump, and don’t you forget it,
Bob. Chances are, Peg will be nursing a banged-up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
nose longer than your knees and elbows will
hurt you.”</p>

<p>“Say, I wonder if this is a sample of what’s
going to strike us on this new venture?” observed
the Kentucky lad. “Because things are coming
our way pretty swift, so far. On the go just a
few hours, and I get yanked out of my saddle. I
reckon I must have seen that rope sailing toward
me, for I can remember throwing up my arm; and
that kept the noose from tightening around my
neck.”</p>

<p>“Just what happened,” nodded Frank; “those
of us who have used the lariat a long time always
do that sort of thing when we think a rope is
whizzing in our direction—throw up a hand, and
duck!”</p>

<p>So they rode on, talking about the recent little
trouble, and making progress. When noon came
a halt was made in order to take a bite, and rest
the horses; for the blazing sun came down with a
fierce directness that made traveling exhausting
to man and beast.</p>

<p>Frank had picked out the place for the noonday
rest. A clear little brooklet gurgled out of a
split in the rock. Undoubtedly it came from the
distant mountains, where snow melted on the
peaks throughout the summer, forming many such
little streams that eventually joined forces with
the mighty Colorado.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“What are you laughing at, Frank?” demanded
Bob, as they sat there, munching some of
the sandwiches the Chinese cook at the ranch
house had put up for them, while the two horses
tried to find some stray bunches of grass near the
water.</p>

<p>“Just happened to remember a time when I got
snaked off the back of a horse, and as sudden as
you did just now,” replied the prairie boy, still
chuckling.</p>

<p>“It must have been funny, then, to make you
act like that so long after it happened,” remarked
Bob. “Tell me about it, Frank.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I can laugh at it now, because it
was several years ago,” the other went on. “At
the time, I tell you it was no joke. You see, I
had jumped on a horse one of the boys was breaking
in. The beast was a little ugly still, and I had
a hackamore in place of a bridle. When he acted
too mean I’d give that a twist, and the cruel rope
caught his jaw in a way to bring him to his senses.”</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” remarked Bob;
“though I’ve never handled a hackamore myself.
Go on, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Well, as we whooped along, it happened that
the beast took a notion to turn sudden-like, and
put into a bunch of trees. And Bob, before I
could say Jack Robinson I found myself snatched
right off that horse by a crotched limb that hung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
low down. The cayuse ran off with me kicking
my heels in the air!”</p>

<p>“Just like Absalom was treated so long ago,
eh, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wasn’t caught up by my hair, because
I wear it short; but I did get caged in that crotch
so it took me a long time to wiggle out. I never
dared tell the boys about it. Say, they’d have
joked me half to death over it. But the shock of
being snatched right off the back of my mount was
just as bad as what you just went through with.
I’ve never forgotten my feelings as I swung up
there, kicking to beat the band, and waving my
arms, but unable to help myself for ten long minutes.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose I’ll remember that queer sensation
I had as I felt myself being pulled out of
my saddle; and in that flash reckoned it must be
some of those reckless cattle rustlers after my
good old Domino. Whew! excuse me from another
experience along that line, Frank.”</p>

<p>“This is a fine place to spend an hour at noon,”
remarked the other, as he lay back to stretch his
legs; for there is always more or less of a
cramped sensation during a long horseback
ride.</p>

<p>“And with that warm sun it makes a fellow
feel sleepy,” added Bob. “If I happen to drop
off into a little doze, please don’t wake me up too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
sudden. I might think I was fast in the noose
of another rope, and strike out, reckless like.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my hands off you for some little
time,” declared Frank; “for I can see that you’re
marked ‘dangerous,’ like a box of dynamite at
the mines.”</p>

<p>When the hour had passed, both boys announced
their readiness to make a fresh start;
and although the heat was still quite severe, they
threw the saddles on the horses, and were soon
off.</p>

<p>Hours later the two found themselves considering
the subject of a camp. The afternoon was
wearing away, and, ere long, night would be at
hand. The moon, past its first quarter, hung in
the sky overhead, so that they need not anticipate
darkness with the coming of sunset.</p>

<p>“Look away off yonder; that line of trees seems
inviting a closer acquaintance,” declared Frank,
pointing; “because, unless I’m greatly mistaken,
there must be a stream of some sort there. Let’s
wind up the day with a little race, Bob!”</p>

<p>The Kentucky boy was always willing for a
trial dash; hence they allowed the two horses to
have their heads across the level plains. And, as
often happened, they arrived at their goal neck
and neck.</p>

<p>“Call it a draw!” laughed Frank, as he threw
himself to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“I’m willing,” replied his chum, proud because
the black was able to keep on even terms with a
horse born and brought up in that country.</p>

<p>First the boys attended to their faithful steeds;
and, only after seeing them comfortable, did they
think to take a drink from the stream, and begin
to get a camp in readiness for the coming night.</p>

<p>Frank was putting up a little silk tent which he
had brought along when he heard Buckskin snorting
loudly. He knew that something strange
must have startled the little beast. Many a time
had he depended on Buckskin to warn him, during
the night, of danger; now, leaving his work, he
hastened to snatch up his rifle, after which he
called to his chum.</p>

<p>“Bob! this way, quick!”</p>

<p>Young Archer had been dipping up some clear
water for the coffee when he heard this sudden
hail. It seemed to breathe of peril; and, quick
to act, he started for the spot where his companion
stood. Seeing that Frank was staring upward toward
the sky Bob allowed his wondering gaze to
travel in that direction. What he discovered
filled him with mingled awe and bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Say, Frank!” he called out; “am I dreaming,
or is that really a runaway balloon drifting this
way, with a man hanging to the broken basket?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="fs80">A VISITOR FROM THE SKIES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“A balloon—yes, that’s what it must be,
Bob!” exclaimed the prairie boy, who had doubtless
never before set eyes on such an object as now
dawned upon his startled vision.</p>

<p>“Sure it is, Frank; I’ve seen ’em lots of times
at the country fairs in Kentucky,” Bob went on,
almost breathlessly, as he reached the side of his
chum.</p>

<p>The two stood watching with wide eyes the
approach of the bulky, unwieldly object, that
nearly dragged along the ground at times, since it
was in a partly collapsed state.</p>

<p>“He seems to be waving his arms at us, Bob!”
declared Frank, whose eyes were nearly as keen
as those of a hawk.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is trying to tell us something, Frank,”
replied the other.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s in a peck of trouble,” suggested
the other.</p>

<p>“I’m most sure of that, for the old gas-bag is
half empty; but the wind carries it along, you see,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Bob remarked, as the balloon continued to head
directly for the spot where they stood.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s afraid it’ll hit the trees?” cried
Frank.</p>

<p>“Huh! I’d rather think he’s afraid it <em>won’t</em>
do that same!” Bob ventured. “For it looks to
me as if that man would give just anything to be
safe on the ground again. See how wild he is
getting, Frank!”</p>

<p>“We must do something for him!” declared
Bob’s chum.</p>

<p>With his eye he gauged the coming on the runaway
balloon. Then he started to run rapidly
forward, turning a little to the left.</p>

<p>“Think it’s going to come here?” questioned
Bob, who had obediently trailed along at the
heels of his chum; for Bob knew that as a rule
Frank could be depended upon to do the right
thing.</p>

<p>“Unless there’s a sudden shift of the wind he’s
bound to; and I don’t expect that to happen,”
came the reply.</p>

<p>Indeed, Bob could himself see that the chances
were as ten to one that they now stood directly
in the path of the coming balloon. It had considerable
momentum, and there was a question as
to whether two boys would be able to curb the
rush of the big gas-bag.</p>

<p>When Bob thought this he failed to give his
comrade full credit for his sagacity. Frank had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
anticipated just that thing. And more than that,
he was prepared to meet the emergency.</p>

<p>Frank was so constituted that he could apply
such practices as came into his daily life to the
needs of the hour. For one thing, he had
noticed that a long and apparently stout rope was
trailing down on the ground. Perhaps it had
once had an anchor of some sort attached; but if
so, this had long since been torn away.</p>

<p>Bob was nerving himself for a tug of war when
the two of them threw their combined weight on
that rope. He was therefore greatly astonished
to hear his chum suddenly exclaim:</p>

<p>“Leave it to me, Bob; but stand by to help, if
I call on you!”</p>

<p>With the words Frank jumped forward. The
balloon had bobbed up again in one of its queer
movements, and passed over their heads. They
could hear the bare-headed man in the broken
basket shouting at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“Grab that rope! Hold her, till I can drop
out!”</p>

<p>Then Frank made a dive, and the rope was in
his hands. Another quick movement that fairly
dazzled Bob, and he saw the prairie boy whip the
end three times around the butt of a small but
fairly stout tree that lay within reach. The boy,
who was accustomed to roping cattle had used the
sapling as a “snubbing post.”</p>

<p>There was a shock, as the rope came taut. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
tree bent far over, and Bob half expected to see it
torn up by the roots, or else break in two.
Neither of these catastrophes came to pass, for
that sapling was made of stern stuff. It bent, but
did not give way. And the mad journey of the
runaway balloon seemed to have been brought to
a successful termination, there, close to the little
patch of timber that grew along the stream near
which the saddle boys had started to make their
lone camp.</p>

<p>It was almost ludicrous to see how quickly the
man in the basket started to get over the edge, and
slide down that rope to the ground.</p>

<p>“He’s badly hurt!” exclaimed Bob, seeing the
air-voyager tumble in a heap, as though unable
to stand upon his legs.</p>

<p>Both boys were at his side in another second.
They had thought the aeronaut must have
swooned because of his injuries, or the sudden
sensation of relief after expecting the worst that
could befall him; but on their arrival he made a
movement as though trying to get up.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m in a bad way, boys,” he groaned.
“Feels like one of my legs has been fractured.
The balloon smashed against a rock as I came
over the top of the ridge away over yonder.
That was what broke the basket. It nearly sent
me out, and ever since I seem to have lost my
head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“Well, you’re safe on the ground now,” said
Frank, as he bent over the injured man.</p>

<p>“We were just making camp when he sighted
you,” said Bob. “And if you say the word we’ll
get you over to the place, and do all we can to
help you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! thank you, boys,” the other said, eagerly;
“it’s very kind of you. Perhaps with your help
I might hobble along in some fashion. But I
can’t get to see a doctor any too soon to suit me.”</p>

<p>The two boys exchanged glances. How in the
wide world they were going to get the wounded
man to a town, where his broken leg could be attended
before serious complications set in, neither
of them could even guess.</p>

<p>But they helped him get on his feet, and foot
by foot make for the spot on the bank of the
small river where the tent was standing. He
groaned frequently, as though suffering great
pain; but in the end they managed to half carry
him to the camp.</p>

<p>Here, on one of the blankets, he was made as
comfortable as possible. While the daylight still
lasted Frank took a look at his limb; leaving to
his chum the task of preparing supper.</p>

<p>“It’s broken, you find?” asked the man, with
great concern.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’m afraid it is; and pretty badly
fractured at that,” Frank answered. “We’ll try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and make you as comfortable as we can to-night.
In the morning perhaps some way for getting you
to a doctor may be found.”</p>

<p>At the time Frank did not know in the slightest
degree just how such a thing could be accomplished.
But he was not one to cross a bridge
before coming to it. There were a good many
hours between supper time and morning; and
surely one of them would be able to think of some
remedy.</p>

<p>As they had been sent off on a very important
errand to Cherry Blossom Mine, where it was
suspected that strange things were in progress, it
was hardly to be expected that they could spare
the time needed to take this stranger to the nearest
town, some twenty miles down the river.</p>

<p>Still, both boys were tender-hearted, and apt
to strain a point rather than appear cruel toward
a fellow human being.</p>

<p>“Is there any way to save the balloon?” asked
Frank, wishing to divert the attention of the
groaning aeronaut from his own pains, to some
other object in which he might take an interest.</p>

<p>“Hang the balloon!” the man said, angrily.
“I never want to set eyes on one again. I was a
fool to believe I could play the part of an aeronaut.
It’s nearly been the death of me; and all
for nothing; all for nothing!”</p>

<p>Frank, of course, could not imagine what the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
man meant by those words. He seemed to be
deeply moved, as though some pet scheme which
he had been trying to carry out had proven a dead
failure. Perhaps he was an explorer, and had
hoped to investigate the secrets of those gaunt
mountains which had never been climbed, and
which might be rich in precious ores!</p>

<p>Frank bathed the injured limb as soon as he
could get some warm water. There was really
nothing else he could do, not being a surgeon.
Of course many cowboys can perform rude operations,
when stern necessity requires; and Frank
had before now, set a broken bone fairly well.
But in this case it was a compound fracture, and
splinters of bone would have to be taken away
before the process of healing could begin.</p>

<p>Bob, meanwhile, managed to get supper ready.
He announced the meal even as Frank finished
his labors in connection with the wounded aeronaut.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you might be able to eat a little; or
at least have a cup of coffee,” Frank remarked,
after he had propped the other up against a tree.</p>

<p>Somehow the man looked a little more cheerful.
His leg did not hurt so badly, for the numb
stage had set in; and so long as he could remain
quiet it would not be so bad.</p>

<p>“This is mighty nice of you two boys,” he declared,
showing that he felt he owed them more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
than common gratitude. “Yes, I haven’t eaten
a bite for many hours, and that coffee certainly
smells good. I will try a little. I’m beginning
to pick up hopes that after all I may be able to
pull through.”</p>

<p>So Bob poured out a cup of the fragrant Java,
and brought it over to where the wounded aeronaut
lay.</p>

<p>“How will you have it, Professor?” he asked,
“with condensed milk, or plain black?”</p>

<p>“A little of the milk, please, my boy; and as I
was just saying to your comrade, I owe you both
a heavy debt. After all, a man’s life is worth
more than anything else. But don’t call me Professor,
for I’m not anything of the sort. Jared
Scott is the name I answer to; and I’m from Iowa,
though long out in the wild and woolly West.
May I ask your name, and that of the fine fellow
who made me so comfortable?”</p>

<p>“My name is Bob Archer,” readily responded
the other; “and my home used to be in Kentucky.
My chum has always lived here in the cow and
mining country. His father owns a big ranch;
and we’re right now on the way to the Cherry
Blossom Mine on business. His name is Haywood—Frank
Haywood.”</p>

<p>Bob heard the man give a low cry, and saw
him staring, as though the mention of that name
had given him a great shock!</p>

<span class="fs80">THE MYSTERY OF THE PACKET</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Bob was not a suspicious boy by nature. Consequently,
the first thought that occurred to him
was that the wrecked balloonist must have been
seized with a sudden acute twinge of pain.</p>

<p>“Does it hurt so bad as that?” he asked, tenderly.</p>

<p>The other shut his teeth hard together, winked
a few times, and then seemed able to master his
emotions.</p>

<p>“I never had such pain in all my life,” he said,
in a voice that shook. “But it’s gone again now,
and I feel easier. Bob, you said your name was,
and his Frank Haywood. His father, then, must
be the Colonel Haywood I’ve heard talked about
as one of the richest men in this section.”</p>

<p>“That’s Frank’s father, all right, Mr. Scott,”
Bob went on, adding enthusiastically, “and
Frank’s the best chum I ever knew in all my life;
as good-hearted as the day is long, loyal and
brave. When he saw your trouble he would have
risked his life, if necessary, to help you; but then,
that’s Frank Haywood, every time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>The balloonist shifted his glance toward Frank,
who was just then pouring himself out a cup of
coffee.</p>

<p>“And me a stranger, too!” he muttered, turning
strangely red in the face, Bob thought, and
also swallowing something that seemed to come
up in his throat.</p>

<p>Then he put the tin cup to his mouth. Perhaps
the coffee was hotter than Mr. Scott had expected,
for when he lowered the cup again Bob thought he
could see a trace of tears in his eyes. But then
a renewal of the pain in his leg might account for
that—or something else of which he, Bob, knew
nothing.</p>

<p>“How is the coffee?” he asked, solicitously,
for he disliked to see any one suffer, and felt for
the wounded man.</p>

<p>“Splendid! and it somehow seems to cheer me
up,” replied the other; though while speaking his
eyes still continued to stray over to where Frank
knelt, as if possibly the prairie boy had appealed
to him especially.</p>

<p>“I’ll fetch you over a share of what we’ve got,
Mr. Scott; and I hope you’ll have appetite enough
to enjoy it,” Bob went on. “In a case like this,
it’s necessary for the patient to keep up his
strength, you know.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Bob,” replied the other, giving
him a faint smile; “and it’s good of you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
your chum to take such care of a stranger who’s
dropped out of the clouds, and about whom
neither of you know a thing.”</p>

<p>“But you’re hurt, you see,” remarked Bob, just
as though that circumstance would account for
almost anything they might do for him.</p>

<p>The wounded man did eat rather heartily, after
all. He was also somewhat morose for a time
after they had finished the meal; his dark brows
knitting as if he might be deep in serious
thought.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s wondering how under the sun
we’re going to get him to town in the morning?”
suggested Bob, who was just as eager to get a
hint from Frank in that line as Mr. Scott could
be, for he did not know a thing about it.</p>

<p>“Now, I was thinking,” Frank remarked,
“that perhaps he’s bothered because some pet
scheme of his has been knocked sky-high by the
smash of the balloon. Who knows what sort of
business brought him out here with that gas-bag?
You know he kept saying ‘all for nothing, too;
all for nothing!’”</p>

<p>“Frank,” said the other boy, in low tones, for
he did not wish the balloonist to suspect that they
were talking about him; “I reckon you’re right,
after all. He is bothered over something that’s
gone to smash, and it isn’t the balloon either.”</p>

<p>“But it’s none of our business, you know,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
urged Frank; “and we don’t want to seem too
curious.”</p>

<p>“But, Frank, we just can’t go off in the morning
and leave the poor fellow here, you know;
yet how under the sun can we get him to town?
He couldn’t ride a horse, with that terribly broken
leg, could he?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” answered the other, smiling.
“But I was thinking, Bob, that if the worst came,
we could make some sort of raft, and in that way
I might drift with him down river, while you followed
along the shore with the horses.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t just beat the world thinking
up things, Frank!” exclaimed the Kentucky boy;
and then seeing the man looking at them curiously,
he added in a louder voice: “What do you think
of that for a scheme, Mr. Scott—my chum says
that if you can’t ride a horse in the morning we
might make a raft, and he’ll run you to town that
way, while I bring the horses along the bank.”</p>

<p>“Could it be done?” asked the wounded man,
as his black eyes sparkled with admiration, and
perhaps pleasure.</p>

<p>“I think so,” replied Frank. “I’ve heard
something about this river from our cow punchers.
It’s swift, but deep, and without many rapids.
Yes, given a little time, and we can make a raft
that would be safe. And by night, or long before,
we’d likely reach a doctor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“But in that way you’d lose a whole day,
Frank,” remarked the balloonist.</p>

<p>“Oh! well, it just can’t be helped. Time is of
value to us just now, I admit; but it would have
to be something far more than the possible loss of
money that could make me desert anyone in
trouble. My dad would never forgive me, Mr.
Scott, if I ran away, and left you here all
alone!”</p>

<p>The balloonist tried to say something, but his
voice failed him. He could only draw a long
breath, and look steadily at Frank. Such sentiments
evidently touched him even more than the
able manner in which Frank had snubbed the runaway
balloon, so that he could escape from the
broken basket.</p>

<p>Nor did he attempt to join in the conversation
of the two lads as they sat by the little fire later
on and talked; though Frank imagined that Mr.
Scott seemed considerably interested in what they
were saying.</p>

<p>Sometimes the talk was about the ranch where
they enjoyed such good times; and numerous allusions
were made to the family, the cowboys, and
the adventures that had already fallen to their
lot.</p>

<p>Then again it might be Bob would ask questions
concerning the possible cause of that hasty summons
of Colonel Haywood to Cherry Blossom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Mine; and what sort of new trouble might await
them there.</p>

<p>Strikes were not unknown in that region; and
somehow the boys seemed to imagine they would
be called upon to face some such thing as that.
Miners from Mexico sometimes fomented trouble,
and a stern hand was needed to keep it down.</p>

<p>Finally the lads found themselves growing
sleepy, and announced their intention of turning
in. With the sagacious Buckskin hovering near
by, and capable of giving warning should danger
threaten, neither of the saddle boys felt called
upon to lose any sleep by standing watch.</p>

<p>Frank fixed the injured balloonist as well as he
was able, before seeking his blanket. They had
even managed to convey their uninvited guest to
the little tent, despite his protests. As for themselves,
they could settle down outside; nor would
they have any reason to regret it, because the
night promised to be a calm one.</p>

<p>It passed away without any alarm. In the
morning the boys were early astir, and making
preparations for breakfast, for it looked as
though they would have to put in this day doing
an act of mercy.</p>

<p>“The old balloon’s gone to nothing during the
night,” announced Bob, after he had gone out to
investigate; but Mr. Scott shook his head as
though it no longer appealed to him in the least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>If he had ever expected to become an aeronaut
the desire had all been taken from him by his
recent experience; and he vowed that if he lived
through this trouble never again would he ever
trust himself off the solid earth.</p>

<p>While the boys were engaged in getting the
morning meal Mr. Scott seemed to be writing
something on a sheet of paper which he had torn
from a note book. This he slipped into a packet
he had with him, and sealed up hastily.</p>

<p>“Hello! Frank, look what’s coming down the
river!” called Bob, just as they were ready to sit
down and eat.</p>

<p>It was a boat, and a fairly large one at that,
loaded with all sorts of green vegetables. Frank
could hardly believe his eyes.</p>

<p>“Here’s luck, Mr. Scott!” he exclaimed.
“This man must have a little truck patch in some
favored place above, where there’s rich ground,
and plenty of water for irrigation. He’s on his
way to town now, with a load that will fetch him
a heap of money. We must hail him, and get him
to take you along. Perhaps he’d agree to carry
the balloon, too, if you wanted.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of the balloon; I hate the thought
of it!” said the other; “but I’m glad there’s a
chance for my getting to a doctor before long,
and without taking you boys away from your
work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Frank jumped up, and waved to the “trucker”
in the boat, who quickly landed. He looked a
little dubious at the suggestion of carrying a man
with a broken leg all the way to town; but when
Mr. Scott took out several large bills, and offered
them to him, he quickly found that he could make
room.</p>

<p>“Stop over a bit and have breakfast with us,”
said Bob, with true Kentucky generosity; and the
“trucker” agreed willingly enough, for he scented
the fragrant coffee.</p>

<p>Then, a little later, they managed to carry the
wounded man to the boat, where a bed had been
prepared for him amid the green stuff.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Mr. Scott!” said Frank, after Bob
had shaken hands with the wounded balloonist.
“We sure hope you come out all right; and we’d
have done what we said we would if this boat
hadn’t come along in time.”</p>

<p>“I know you would, Frank,” said the other,
with a queer look on his face; then he suddenly
drew out the packet, and offered it to the boy.
“Take it, please,” he insisted, seeing Frank hesitate.
“Only promise me that you will not break
the seal for seven days! By then things will have
taken a turn for me, one way or the other. Give
me your word, Frank!”</p>

<p>Mystified by this Frank could only promise.
Then the boat pushed off, and the last they saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
of Jared Scott was when he turned half-way
around to wave a hand.</p>

<p>And Frank stood there, staring at the little
packet the wounded balloonist had forced him to
accept under conditions that only added to the
puzzle.</p>

<span class="fs80">IN SEARCH OF GAME</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“What under the sun did he mean by that,
Frank?” asked Bob, after the boat had swept
around a bend on the swift river, and vanished
from their view.</p>

<p>“I declare I can’t tell you,” chuckled his chum,
looking at the envelope, which he was turning over
in his hand.</p>

<p>“He was writing something, and then I saw
him put it in that envelope, or packet, smiling all
the time as if delighted; which I thought was
rather queer for a man who was suffering from
such a bad leg,” Bob went on.</p>

<p>“Well, we must let it go at guessing; because
you heard me promise not to tear this envelope
open for seven days,” Frank remarked.</p>

<p>“That was the queer part of it,” the other
pursued, for anything touching on a mystery always
excited Bob. “Now if, for instance, he
had been making out a check, thinking to reward
us for saving his life, he wouldn’t have gone
about it that way, and make you give such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
promise. Besides I saw that he just tore a blank
page out of a note book, and scribbled on that.”</p>

<p>Frank calmly put the strange little packet safely
away in an inside pocket of his jacket.</p>

<p>“Seven days from now we’ll take a peep, Bob,”
he observed, drily; “just try and curb your curiosity
till then; won’t you? And now, we’d better
forget all about Mr. Jared Scott, and his balloon.
It served to break up the monotony of our trip,
and cost us little besides our time.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Bob; “but something
tells me, Frank, that this isn’t the last we’ll hear
from this Mr. Scott. The way he looked at you
told me he sure had something on his mind. Shall
we throw our saddles on right now, and get
busy?”</p>

<p>Frank, instead of replying, began to gather
things together. The tent came down in a “jiffy,”
as Bob called it; the cooking things were soon
placed in the blankets; and presently not a thing
had been neglected.</p>

<p>Bob went over to where the pile of silk representing
the abandoned balloon, lay. When he
came back he was carrying quite a piece of the
material, which he said he expected to keep, as a
souvenir of the affair.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, now, you’re thinking of some day
taking up the life of a balloonist?” suggested
Frank, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“None of that for me,” Bob answered. “After
seeing how Mr. Scott fared, I’d hate to think of
an experience of that sort. And just imagine him
being carried over the tops of those mountains at
a tremendous whirl. He said he even banged into
a rock that stuck up above the rest. And Frank,
do you see, he came out of just the same quarter
we are heading into!”</p>

<p>The two boys looked at each other. It was as
if some thought had flashed into both of their
minds, to the effect that, perhaps, the circumstances
might prove to be more than just a mere
coincidence. But farther than this they were not
able to go; so nothing was said.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more both sprang into the
saddle. Then the eager horses were off on the
jump across the plains, heading toward the very
mountains which the wounded aeronaut declared
he had crossed while cruising in his runaway balloon.</p>

<p>“Oh! we forgot to ask Mr. Scott how he
happened to get in trouble!” Bob suddenly cried,
after he had been turning around to take a last
look at the pile of silk which had once been a
balloon.</p>

<p>“He told me while I was fixing his broken
limb,” Frank mentioned. “That is, he said that
in his hurry to get away, he was unlucky enough
to break something about the balloon that controlled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the valve. So he was really at the mercy
of the wind. He said he had been knocking
around for many hours—in fact that he had been
high up in the air part of the day; until the gas
began to escape, and then the balloon dropped until
he just scraped over the mountains, as he
mentioned. Later on he came close to the ground;
but was going so fast he hated to jump.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I don’t blame him, what with that broken
leg,” commented Bob, who was keeping alongside
his galloping chum. “But if he was up all
day, he must have come hundreds of miles.
Wonder if he started at Los Angeles, in California?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe that,” Frank went on,
thoughtfully; “because I remember his saying
that he seemed to go in circles, and that after being
up all those hours, when he sank down again,
he was within twenty miles of where he started.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, perhaps some day we’ll know more
about it,” Bob remarked, carelessly. “He must
have come from some city where they had gas.
Perhaps he was doing it on a wager. They do
all sorts of queer things nowadays, with the idea
of taking up a dare.”</p>

<p>“Seven days and we’ll know, I reckon,” laughed
Frank, touching his breast, where in the recesses
of a pocket that little packet lay with its mysterious
contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“I’m glad, anyhow, that we didn’t have to
make that raft,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“Same here,” chuckled his comrade, “it would
have been a tougher job than either of us thought,
with only a little camp hatchet to cut logs. But
I would have done it if that trucker hadn’t come
along in his bull boat.”</p>

<p>“Which, I take it, means his craft was made
from the tough skins of bulls; is that right,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Frank replied. “They make fine
boats, too, and I’m told are used even up in the
Saskatchewan river country. Far better than
dugouts, too. But our trail leads us through that
far-away mountain range, you know. Hope
we’re on the other side of it by to-night. All depends
on how rough the traveling is, after we
strike the rise.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, if we look sharp, we may see the
very rock at the peak that the balloon banged up
against!” suggested Bob, with a grin.</p>

<p>“No telling,” Frank remarked. “But if he
had been knocked out of the old basket on top of
the ridge, he would have been a goner, sure
enough. No help could reach him there.”</p>

<p>They galloped on for several hours. All the
time the mountains seemed to rise up closer,
though distances were very deceptive in that clear
atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>But no stop was made until noon. Then they
found themselves at the base of the high ridge,
that loomed up far into the clouds.</p>

<p>“If we could only find a way around this, instead
of climbing over,” observed the Kentucky
lad, as he looked upward with a sigh of despair.</p>

<p>“Hold on, its bite isn’t as bad as its bark,”
broke in Frank. “From dad’s directions I understand
that to try and go around would mean
three days’ ride, because the ridge runs quite a
ways in both directions. Then there’s a canyon
here, just as if Nature wanted to help a fellow
cross over. It doesn’t go to near the top; and
horses can easily tramp through it.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear that,” declared Bob, with an air
of relief. “I might climb up to the top yonder,
on my hands and knees; but I’d hate the job of
taking Domino there.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hold up, and take a breathing
spell,” Frank suggested, as he reined in, and
threw himself to the ground.</p>

<p>Presently the boys were stretching themselves,
while the horses sought the water hole near by,
to quench their thirst. A “snack” was eaten.
Then Bob, remarking that he believed he would
take a little look around, as the place had a promising
air to an ambitious hunter, threw his rifle
over his shoulder, and stalked off.</p>

<p>“Don’t go far, Bob,” said his chum; “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
be back in half an hour or so; for if we hope to
get across the range by nightfall we’ll have to be
making a start inside of an hour or so.”</p>

<p>“All right, Frank, you can count on me,” was
the reply Bob threw back, as he plunged into the
chaparral, with his hunter’s instinct aroused.</p>

<p>Ten minutes had passed since he left Frank.
As yet he had seen nothing more than a brace
of long-eared jack rabbits; and Bob hated to fire
at such ignoble game when his mind was set upon
something better.</p>

<p>Still, jack rabbit stew was not bad, and if it
came to it he supposed there was nothing else to
be done but knock over a couple. But he would
go on a little further before giving up. Frank
had limited him to half an hour; and that would
leave him just fifteen minutes in which to retrace
his steps.</p>

<p>Ah! what was that he saw through the bushes
ahead? Something moved, and as he looked
closer Bob discovered that it was a deer. The
wind was coming from the feeding animal, directly
toward him, which would account for his having
been able to approach as near as he had without
being scented.</p>

<p>So Bob, dropping on his knees, crawled a little
closer. Then, seeing uneasiness in the game, and
knowing that he could hardly hope to get any
closer, the boy raised himself cautiously, and took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
aim, resting one elbow on his knee for support.</p>

<p>With the report the deer sprang into the air.
Bob knew that his aim must have been true, and
that the timid animal had received its death
wound.</p>

<p>But something that was entirely unexpected by
Bob took place immediately after he had pulled
the trigger. He heard what seemed to be a half
suppressed snarl, and was even in the act of trying
to turn, while in that awkward position, when he
received a violent blow on the shoulder that sent
him sprawling.</p>

<p>And, even as he fell, Bob had a glimpse of a
terrifying beast with yellow eyes that had dropped
from the trees upon his shoulders. He knew that
it must be a panther that had been trying to stalk
the feeding deer!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="fs80">SURPRISING FRANK</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There are times when one simply acts from
impulse rather than from design. And this was
certainly one of those occasions.</p>

<p>Bob had been thrown aside by the stroke from
the heavy paw of the descending beast. He
simply kept on rolling, and thus avoided being
pounced upon when the panther, like a domestic
cat cheated out of its prey by the first jump,
turned to make a second attempt.</p>

<p>Better still, Bob had been wise enough not to
loosen his grip on his gun. Hence he was not
unarmed when he threw himself behind a friendly
tree, and fumbled at the mechanism of the repeating
rifle, meaning to eject the useless empty
brass shell, and bring another from the magazine
into the firing chamber.</p>

<p>It seems a very simple act when attempted under
ordinary conditions. But if a young hunter
can manage to accomplish the same when an
angry panther is within five feet of him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
ready for a renewal of its attack, he deserves
much praise. Four out of five would make a
mess of trying to work the “pump-gun,” with results
not at all pleasant.</p>

<p>But Bob went through with the two movements
necessary to attain this end without a hitch. This
left his gun in condition for immediate use, with
the hammer pushed back, ready for a discharge.</p>

<p>Just then he saw that the big cat was about
to launch itself through the air again. It had
crouched, with its head between its forepaws;
and there was a “hunching” movement to the
whole body. Bob had seen exactly the same when
a pet Maltese cat was about to spring on an unsuspecting
sparrow.</p>

<p>He knew that a second would count for a
great deal under such circumstances. It would
not do to even try and raise the gun to his
shoulder to aim; for the panther might be in the
air before he could glance along that shiny barrel.</p>

<p>Instinct again forced Bob to pull the trigger.
How he did it he never could explain; but he
fired the shot from his hip, and with his eyes
glued upon the figure of his enemy.</p>

<p>Bob had all the instincts of a true hunter. When
he heard a story told that had to do with an encounter
with dangerous game he never failed to
ask a multitude of questions. And in this way
he had gained a pretty good idea of how successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
big game hunters carry themselves under
perilous conditions.</p>

<p>Hence he had no sooner fired than he hastened
to fling himself behind another tree that happened
to be within reach.</p>

<p>Something came slap against it. He heard a
low growl, that seemed to change into short angry
whines; and glancing around the tree, after he
had made his gun serviceable again, he discovered
the animal kicking its last, biting at every object
within reach of its teeth, and evidently dying
hard.</p>

<p>There was no longer any danger to be apprehended
from this source; and it was only his desire
not to allow needless pain that urged Bob to
once more throw his rifle forward, and pull the
trigger.</p>

<p>Then the panther lay very still, and the lad
knew that the last spark of life had departed.</p>

<p>Bob stood there, looking around him. He was
trembling violently, yet it was the result of excitement
and action, rather than anything like fear.</p>

<p>In fact, one thing had followed so fast upon
the heels of others, that thus far he had not
found time to be afraid.</p>

<p>“Probably I would have been, if the beast had
given me a chance,” he said afterward, when
telling Frank about the happening.</p>

<p>He had done an amazing thing—killed a deer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
and a panther, both within the space of three
minutes or less.</p>

<p>Of course Frank must have heard the several
shots, and might be growing anxious about him.
So Bob decided to return to camp. On the horses
they could cover the intervening ground in a
short time; and after that take as much of the
venison along as Frank thought best.</p>

<p>After noting the spot so that he could easily
locate it again, Bob hurried away. He found
his chum looking anxiously for him; and noted the
smile of relief that came upon Frank’s face as he
broke cover close by.</p>

<p>“He got away after all that hammering, eh?”
remarked the prairie lad; but in a good natured
manner.</p>

<p>“After we start, suppose we run over that way
a little,” said Bob. “It won’t take a long time;
and there’s something I’d like to show you.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Frank, as he prepared to
mount. “No use asking what it is; for once
you’ve made up your mind to keep a surprise, a
mountain wouldn’t move <em>you</em>, Bob.”</p>

<p>First of all, Bob led him by a round-about
way to where the deer lay, just as it had fallen,
although Bob had stopped long enough to bleed
his quarry.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” he asked a little proudly.</p>

<p>Frank jumped down, and bent over the animal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
And, just as his comrade anticipated, he almost
immediately exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Your bullet took him directly back of the
foreshoulder, Bob; and must have cut into his
heart. Then what in the wide world did you
want to fire twice again for?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I had a little dispute with a rival hunter,
and he thought I’d played him a mean trick to
step in when he was creeping up on the game. So
we had it out; and if you come this way, Frank,
I’ll show you how it all ended.”</p>

<p>When the wondering Frank looked down on
the sleek form of the mountain cat, he emitted a
whistle that meant astonishment.</p>

<p>“Great governor! however did you do it; and
come out of the scrape without even a single
scratch, too?” he asked, turning on Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, hardly that,” replied the other, wincing
when Frank unconsciously laid a hand on his left
shoulder. “If you look where you touched me
you’ll see that my jacket and flannel shirt are
clawed some. I reckon there’s need of that
wonderful permanganate of potash wash that
you think so much of.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll have to let me look at that
shoulder right away, son,” declared Frank. “I
never take any chances when clawed by an animal
that lives on flesh. If blood poisoning ever sets
in, it’s bound to be a bad job. And while I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
working you just pitch in, and tell me all about
it; d’ye hear?”</p>

<p>Of course Bob complied. He was just aching
to tell the story anyhow, boy-like. And Frank
could easily picture the exciting scene, as he
looked around him, and noted where the beast
had first clawed up the ground when he just
missed the form of the human hunter who had
invaded his private preserves.</p>

<p>“Whew! things seem to be coming your way
right along, Bob,” he remarked after both the
story, and his dressing of the trifling wounds, were
finished.</p>

<p>“They say it’s better to be born lucky than
rich,” his chum laughed. “And if I can keep
on in this way I’ve no kick coming. But how
about the deer meat, Frank? We ought to take
some of that along with us, hadn’t we?”</p>

<p>“I should say yes,” declared Frank, as he
pulled out his hunting knife, and once more
moved toward the spot where the deer lay.</p>

<p>“But I’d like ever so much to have this nice
pelt to remember the affair by,” Bob remarked,
casting a regretful eye back toward the dead
panther.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take it off, if you will carve some
meat from your deer,” Frank answered, knowing
just how the tenderfoot felt about the matter.
“Of course, we couldn’t think of taking it along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
with us now; but I’ll hang it up in a tree, and on
our way home we’ll try and remember it. How’s
that, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy,” replied the other. “I
won’t promise to cut the steaks as well as you
could; but I’ll do my best; and they can be eaten
anyhow. So here goes!”</p>

<p>He had, before now, taken some lessons in
cutting up game, and was not altogether ignorant
of the method. And by the time the practical
Frank had hung the skin of the panther high up
on a branch, Bob was on hand with a bundle of
fresh meat, wrapped in a part of the deer’s hide.</p>

<p>“Say, if we keep on like this I reckon our
new trip will see all the others, and go them one
better,” declared Bob, after he had fastened the
package to his horse.</p>

<p>They rode off, and Frank, having found the
pass leading over the mountain ridge, the laborious
task of climbing the height was commenced.</p>

<p>But both horses proved game. At half-past
three Frank announced that they had ascended as
high as the canyon ran. From that point the
pass would decline, making it much easier for
the animals. Here Bob saw his first flock of
great vultures, perched upon some of the high
rocks the balloonist had spoken of.</p>

<p>During the balance of the afternoon they rode
steadily downward; and as the evening drew near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Frank declared that they were going to make
their point, which was to leave the mountain
range behind them.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we cross another mesa,” he said,
“and then come to the mountains where the
Cherry Blossom blooms.”</p>

<p>“Then we stand a chance of getting there by
to-morrow night?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Unless something stops us that I don’t see
just now,” replied the prairie boy, as he looked
around as usual for a good camp-site.</p>

<p>Before the sun’s glow had begun to fade from
the glorious western heavens the two saddle boys
had turned their horses loose, and were hard at
work with their preparations for spending another
night under the moon and stars.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="fs80">CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Frank, wake up!”</p>

<p>Possibly that was the first time on record when
the late tenderfoot had found a chance to arouse
his chum from sleep, and the strange part of it
was Frank never knew how it happened that he
had been slumbering so heavily on that particular
night.</p>

<p>When his comrade shook him he was of course
wide awake in a second; and sat up in the tent,
that gave very little more than head room for the
two.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s wrong?” he asked, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“I happened to wake up, and heard Buckskin
snorting to beat the band,” said Bob, his own
voice showing evidence of trembling. “Listen,
there he goes again, Frank! Doesn’t that sound
as if he wanted to let you know?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what it does, Bob!”</p>

<p>Even as he uttered these low words Frank
was reaching out for his gun. He felt very queerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
about the fact of his not having heard the
least sound until his comrade aroused him.</p>

<p>“My! but I must have been in the grip of a
nightmare!” Bob heard him mutter.</p>

<p>Both boys now had hold of their guns. Frank
was the first to crawl out from the shelter of the
small tent. He thrust his head from under the
canvas, as a cautious old tortoise might, when
taking an observation, in order to make sure the
coast was clear.</p>

<p>The moon hung in the western sky. Judging
from its position, Frank, who always studied
these things, guessed that the hour must be somewhere
near half-past one; for the moon was due
to set shortly after two on this night.</p>

<p>As he crawled out he found himself in the
shelter of the cluster of trees under which the tent
had been erected. The fact was of considerable
importance just then, since his movements were
apt to be screened, should there be any enemies
around.</p>

<p>Buckskin was snorting again at a great rate.
Frank had given him all the rope when fixing him
for the night. He could be heard plunging
around; but there seemed an absence of galloping,
such as the prairie horse was apt to indulge
in when he did not like the way things looked.</p>

<p>Frank’s first thought was that, after all, it
might prove to be a false alarm. Perhaps Buckskin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
had only managed to catch his tether in some
root; and finding himself held up short was trying
to notify his master, so that Frank could come
to his relief.</p>

<p>“What is it?” breathed a voice in his ear, as
Bob joined him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet,” Frank replied, but from
the manner in which he said it, his comrade understood
that he fully intended finding out soon.</p>

<p>When Frank started to creep away Bob followed.
He did not mean to be left in the lurch,
if there was any excitement on foot.</p>

<p>Of course Bob was greatly exercised. He had
not been through an experience like this as often
as the boy who had spent his life, or at least
pretty much all of it, on the range, and hence
knew what a cowboy has to endure.</p>

<p>Bob was secretly not a little provoked because
his chum had thus far given him no hint whatever
as to his suspicions. For, of course, it went
without saying that Frank could make a pretty
good guess from Buckskin’s actions whether it
might turn out to be wolves, a hungry panther, or
Indians from the reservation, sneaking around to
see what they could pick up on the sly.</p>

<p>When Buckskin stopped his snorting for a few
seconds, Frank would himself halt, and appear to
be listening intently.</p>

<p>Bob put in such opportunities by using his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
to the best possible advantage; but he could see
absolutely nothing, as yet.</p>

<p>As they were steadily approaching the place
where the two horses had been staked out, Bob
knew that presently they must arrive at a point
where the animals at least could be seen. And
then it should be possible to learn the cause of all
this commotion.</p>

<p>Now the second animal seemed to join in with
fresh vigor. Domino, although not a native of
the plains, and hitherto unaccustomed to such
perils as existed there, must have been taking
lessons from the yellow pony.</p>

<p>“Whew!” Bob whispered to himself, “aren’t
they just keeping it up lively, though? Domino is
trying to beat the other at his own game, and
he can do it, too, every time, once he learns
how!”</p>

<p>Frank nudged him with his foot, which was a
plain invitation to stop holding any conversation
with himself; for Bob’s whisper had been in the
nature of a low grumble.</p>

<p>The trample of horses’ hoofs now sounded
more clearly; and Bob, using his eyes to the best
of his ability, found that he could see a wildly
moving form. Undoubtedly this must be
Domino, rushing around as far as his rope would
permit.</p>

<p>Frank had reached a point where he fancied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
that a change in their tactics would prove of advantage.
Progress in this creeping fashion was
too slow. He surprised Bob by suddenly jumping
to his feet, and starting forward, at the same
time shouting over his shoulder:</p>

<p>“Come on! Horse thieves, Bob!”</p>

<p>He could not possibly have said anything that
would have electrified the Kentucky boy more
than that. Bob loved his black mount, and it
would have almost broken his heart had anyone
managed to steal Domino.</p>

<p>He instantly followed Frank in making a forward
rush.</p>

<p>There was a confusion of sounds just ahead,
amid which could be heard the vicious squealing
of the buckskin pony, which, being possibly held
a prisoner by its entangled rope, could only let
fly with its heels in the hope of beating off the
enemy.</p>

<p>Frank could see by now, his eyes being better
than those of his chum. He paid no attention to
the wildly cavorting Domino, knowing that so
long as the black had the benefit of his entire
rope it would indeed be a bold, as well as skillful
rustler, who could throw a leg over his glossy
back.</p>

<p>And, even as they were thus hurrying to arrive
upon the scene, a dusky figure suddenly made
a flying leap, landing on the back of the yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
pony. Frank saw the man bending forward the
very instant he gained his seat. He knew what
that action meant, and that a keen knife was being
drawn over the holding lariat.</p>

<p>Now Buckskin was free from his tether. He
could be seen for the first time rearing in the
air, as a cow pony always will when full of spirit,
or excited.</p>

<p>Frank had thrown his rifle half way to his
shoulder on the impulse of the moment. Then,
as if on second thought, he let it drop again; and
Bob actually believed he heard him give vent to
a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you shoot at him, Frank?” the
latter cried, excitedly. “Look! he’s going to
run away with your horse!”</p>

<p>“Is he?” answered Frank. “Well, perhaps
you’ve got another guess coming, Bob. Maybe
the shoe is on the other foot; and Buckskin is
going to run away with him! Watch what happens,
Bob!”</p>

<p>“Oh! look at the pony kick up!” gasped Bob.
“But that’s a good rider, Frank. He sticks like
a leech, and he may beat the horse at his own
game!”</p>

<p>“Wait!”</p>

<p>Frank knew his horse. He had won a victory
over the vicious little beast only after the longest
fight recorded in the history of Circle Ranch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
And among the cow punchers there were few indeed
who could stick on the back of Buckskin
when he started his bucking tactics.</p>

<p>There the two boys stood, in the shadow of
the trees, looking upon as stirring a little scene
as could be imagined. Bob clutched his chum’s
arm, and almost held his breath with awe as he
gazed; for this certainly excelled anything he had
ever witnessed.</p>

<p>The intending horse thief was indeed a clever
rider. No other could have held his seat on the
bare back of that jumping pony for half a minute,
with only the assistance of a fragment of
rope to give him support.</p>

<p>And it was the admiration Frank felt for the
fellow’s grit that really kept him from resorting
to his gun to wind matters up. Besides, Frank
believed that in due time Buckskin would amply
prove that he was able to take care of himself.</p>

<p>Sometimes the maddened pony would seem to
have its four hoofs in the air at once. Then,
quickly following, Buckskin would raise himself
on his hind legs, and make a furious whirl calculated
to unseat all but the most expert rider.</p>

<p>The fellow stuck through it all. Three times
Frank gave a grunt as he thought the end had
come, for he fancied the rider must be toppling
from his seat; but in each instance the unknown
thief managed to recover himself before it was
too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps by this time the fellow would have
been only too glad of a chance to make a swift
retreat; but the truth was he did not dare throw
himself to the ground with that enraged little
animal loose. It seemed that he had made a terrible
mistake, and could only abide by it now.</p>

<p>So he clung desperately to the back of the
buckskin pony, which seemed able to display an
astonishing array of tricks in the endeavor to
dislodge its hated rider.</p>

<p>Frank heard the rapid pounding of hoofs not
far away, and judged from this that the thief
had a comrade who was making off as fast as his
own horse could take him, leaving the luckless one
to his fate.</p>

<p>Of course Frank could have brought his pony
galloping toward him at any minute by a shrill
whistle that Buckskin had been taught to respect;
but he did not give it.</p>

<p>Things were moving along as well as anyone
could want; and it looked as though that particular
horse thief was bound to learn a lesson he
would never forget.</p>

<p>As if not in the least at the end of his resources,
the yellow pony now started on a new
tack; and Bob’s eye could hardly follow his
swift and eccentric motions.</p>

<p>“Oh! there he goes flying, Frank!” the Kentucky
lad suddenly gasped.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="fs80">THE SILENCE AT CHERRY BLOSSOM</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buckskin had done it!</p>

<p>Some new and entirely unexpected trick had
caught that clever and alarmed horse-thief napping.
Torn from his hold, he found himself
hurled over the head of the animal. Bob could
hear the heavy thud as he struck the ground.</p>

<p>“Wow! that hurt some, I tell you, Frank?”
he cried.</p>

<p>“Watch!” said the other, tersely.</p>

<p>There was about one chance in three that the
man who had been so violently dislodged from
his seat might have broken his neck. This fellow
was either agile, or lucky enough to avoid such a
happening. They saw him roll over several
times, and then scramble to his knees.</p>

<p>The yellow pony gave a savage little squeal.
Evidently Buckskin was not satisfied with having
simply gotten rid of the unpleasant burden he had
been carrying. The insult rankled deep, and
hence he made for the spot where the now
alarmed wretch was struggling to his feet, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
the desire to escape holding chief place in his
mind.</p>

<p>There arose a series of yells and angry squeals
and snorts. Buckskin could be seen taking furious
nips at the man, who was trying to beat him
off as well as he was able, and all the while yelling
lustily for help.</p>

<p>Teeth and hoofs were giving the rascal all he
could manage; and unless something soon came
to pass to change matters, there was no telling
what would happen to one venturesome horse
thief who, as Bob expressed it, had “bitten off
more than he could chew.”</p>

<p>Frank was only waiting until he thought that
the fellow had been sufficiently punished, when
he expected to call the animal off. It was of
course a question whether the enraged Buckskin
would obey the call; and in case he refused, some
other means must be taken to save the life of the
fellow who was dodging, lighting, and howling
with all his might.</p>

<p>“Frank, he’ll kill him!” exclaimed Bob, who
could hardly move, so deeply interested had he
been by this strange happening that had taken
place before them, as though the performance
had been especially arranged for their benefit.</p>

<p>Apparently the other must have just come to
the same conclusion.</p>

<p>“Here, hold my gun, Bob!” he remarked;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
and when the transfer had been accomplished
Frank put his fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>A shrill whistle pealed forth. Buckskin ceased
his astonishing actions, and, with a whinny,
started rapidly toward the spot where his master
waited.</p>

<p>Once the yellow horse paused, and turned half
around, as though strongly tempted to disobey,
and go back for another dance with the horse
thief; who, taking advantage of the opening, was
limping away in a hurry.</p>

<p>Frank sent out another whistle; and this
settled matters. Buckskin dared not disobey.
Possibly he had in a measure satisfied his desire
for revenge, and felt that he could afford to let
the thief get away in a crippled condition.</p>

<p>“Good old chap!” said Frank, as he fondled
the muzzle of the intelligent pony. “The rustler
that gets you will have to be a better man than
that one you just nibbled at!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a wonder, though!” declared the admiring
Bob. “I never would have believed that
a horse could be so smart. And if you hadn’t
called him off, Frank, ten chances to one that fellow
would have paid dearly for wanting to get
our mounts.”</p>

<p>“I rather think he has paid dearly for it,
right now,” laughed the other. “Just feel of
these teeth, and tell me how you’d like to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
them taking hold of your shoulder. And if the
pony managed to strike him a few times with his
forefeet, they’d leave black and blue marks.”</p>

<p>“Think they’ll come back to try it on again?”
asked Bob, though he himself never had the
slightest belief of that.</p>

<p>Frank laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>“Say,” he remarked. “I don’t believe you
could hire either of those fellows to take a look
in at our little camp again, for love or money.
That last one knows when he’s got enough, anyhow.
There he’s found his own horse, and is
kicking his heels into his sides. All he wants is
to put a few miles between his own back and the
little buckskin pony.”</p>

<p>“What will we do now?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh! well, the first thing for me to do is to
patch up my rope again, because, you see, that
rustler sliced it off short. Then I’ll stake the
pony out. After that, me to crawl under the tent
once more. It’s a great thing to be able to sleep,
while your horse keeps watch, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what Domino thought of it all; and
if he’ll take pattern by it?” remarked the Kentucky
boy. “You see, he’s got a heap to learn,
just like his master; but I have hopes that both
of us will climb up out of the tenderfoot class
right soon now.”</p>

<p>“You’re both getting there,” laughed Frank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
as he walked over to where he would find the
main part of his lariat.</p>

<p>This he managed to fix in a temporary manner
that would do until he could get at it by daylight.
And Buckskin acted quite as though proud of
what he had done. He started to nibble at the
grass near by; but Bob noticed, with more or
less amusement, that the pony kept raising his
head, and looking eagerly around, every half
minute or so.</p>

<p>“He’s hoping that another of the same kind
will come, and try it on, Frank,” Bob declared,
with a merry laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, then, he’s going to be badly disappointed,”
the other replied; “because those fellows
are miles away by now, and still going
licketty-split to get out of this section. It’s some
warm here for their breed. Even the horses are
hungry to take a grab at ’em.”</p>

<p>Accordingly both boys crawled under the little
shelter, which Frank called a “dog tent,” from
having seen the regulars of the army fashion
just such a rain-proof from a couple of rubber
ponchos, under which two soldiers could keep the
upper parts of their bodies from much of the
moisture.</p>

<p>It took Bob a long time to get to sleep again.
He was not used to such exciting sessions in the
night; and, despite his determination to forget,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
he tossed and turned for almost an hour before
slumbering.</p>

<p>Frank, on the other hand, seemed to be asleep
inside of five minutes after his head rested on
the pillow made of his saddlebags. Nor did
either of them show signs of uneasiness after
Bob finally managed to conquer his wakefulness,
until the dawn came and aroused Frank.</p>

<p>“Hope we can make the mine by to-night,”
remarked Bob, as they sat there a little later, enjoying
their breakfast, which consisted of coffee
and venison; and of course this fresh meat tasted
all the sweeter to Bob because it had fallen to
his gun.</p>

<p>“With anything like decent luck we ought to
show up there,” Frank observed. “And the
closer we get to the Cherry Blossom district the
more I find myself wondering what sort of trouble
we’re going to find ourselves up against.”</p>

<p>“You must remember that I’ve never visited
the mine, Frank, even if my father does hold a
lot of the stock, and in conjunction with your
family controls the operation of the works.
Who’s the foreman or superintendent in charge?”</p>

<p>“A man by the name of Gustave Riley is superintendent,
and he’s been in charge for a long time
now,” Frank replied.</p>

<p>“Your father trusts him, then?” pursued the
other; for truth to tell, Bob expected some day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
to become a lawyer, and he often showed signs
of the profession even now, by investigating, questioning,
and figuring out results.</p>

<p>“Well, he has all this while, and so far as I
know Riley has played a straight game,” Frank
replied. “But dad told me to go slow, and be
sure of my ground before I either trusted anyone,
or suspected them of treachery. One thing seems
sure, and that is the prospect of our finding that
there’s been some sort of rascality going on at
the Cherry Blossom.”</p>

<p>“The temptation is great, for one thing,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Frank went on, thoughtfully; “because
of late the ore has been richer than ever, so we
hear.”</p>

<p>“And about that letter of warning, does your
father have any suspicion who wrote it?” Bob
asked.</p>

<p>“He thought of a number of people who
might have sent it, but in the end admitted that
he was all up in the air. You see, Bob, while it
didn’t go into details at all, it gave him to understand
that the writer chanced to know there was
some bad business on foot, which could only be
nipped in the bud by prompt action. And it
made dad so provoked, to think that his game leg
must keep him at the ranch just when he was
needed so badly in the other place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>“I only hope we can fill the bill with credit,”
sighed Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going to do our level best,” declared
Frank, “and that’s about all anybody
could do. When I size matters up, I expect to
understand just who are loyal, and who have gone
over to the other side. Then there are going to
be some wholesale discharges. I’ve got all the
authority needed, and I won’t be afraid to use it,
either.”</p>

<p>“I like to hear you talk like that, Frank,” the
other said.</p>

<p>“That’s the only way, Bob. We were given
to understand by the writer of the letter that was
not signed by any name, that the Cherry Blossom
needed an overhauling, unless we were willing to
let unscrupulous parties profit at our expense.
Just think how that leaves me guessing, will
you?”</p>

<p>“But Frank, we’ll know more in ten hours than
we do now; and that’s a heap of comfort,” Bob
managed to remark, confidently.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” agreed the other.</p>

<p>“I saw you looking at that little packet the
wrecked balloonist handed over,” Bob went on to
say. “Were you thinking of opening it ahead of
time, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not,” replied the other. “How
anxious you are to know what’s in that envelope.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Perhaps, after all, it doesn’t make a bit of difference
to us. Mr. Jared Scott may only have
been thinking about his own private affairs. How
do we know but what he only wants us to communicate
with some of his people, after a certain
time has elapsed? Anyhow, it might as well lie
there for six more days; but I see that you’re going
to give me little peace till then.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re rubbing it in on me,” remonstrated
Bob. “Fact is, I only feel curious because
he looked so queerly at you when he heard
your name. Strikes me that perhaps what’s in
the envelope might give us a clue to what’s been
going on over at the Cherry Blossom mine!”</p>

<p>Frank looked at him closely.</p>

<p>“That’s only a guess on your part, Bob; you
don’t know anything to point that way, do you?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“No, can’t say that I do,” admitted the Kentucky
lad.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll just try to forget about it all for
a while,” was Frank’s concluding decision; and
Bob urged him no more.</p>

<p>They got off to a flying start soon after, and
left behind them the high ridge that had come so
near ending the career of the balloonist, Mr.
Scott. During the morning the two horses kept
pretty steadily at their work of putting the miles
behind them. By two in the afternoon they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
reached the other chain of mountains, in the heart
of which the famous gold mine lay.</p>

<p>Both boys began to show signs of anxiety, the
nearer they drew to the scene of the trouble.</p>

<p>“We can make it all right, can’t we, Frank?”
asked Bob, as they found themselves surrounded
on all sides by the wildest kind of rocky scenery,
through which the trail zigzagged, with gigantic
walls towering above their heads.</p>

<p>“No trouble about it,” replied the other.
“Fact is, Bob, right now I’m rather expecting to
sight some of the boys above there. If the wind
was right we could see the smoke from the stamp
mill and the ore crusher. And that makes me
remember how I heard the machinery working
sooner than this the last time father brought me
over to the Cherry Blossom.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t get the sound of the stamp
mill or the crusher now?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s all as silent as the grave,” replied Frank,
looking into the troubled eyes of his chum, with
a set expression on his own face. “That would
seem to mean the mine is shut down. But look
up there; isn’t that a man waving his hat to us
right now?”</p>

<span class="fs80">A THREATENING STORM</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“You’re right, Frank,” remarked Bob, after
a searching look.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he expected us?” suggested the
other, as they continued to advance up the trail
that led through the canyon.</p>

<p>“Why, how under the sun could he?” exploded
Bob. “We didn’t send any word about
our visit, you know. And besides, only for your
father’s lame leg, he would have made the
journey himself.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I know all that, Bob; but what I mean
is this: You can see he is waving at us as if in
friendly greeting. Now, at such a time as this,
with a strike on at the mine, most likely, any
stranger coming toward the Cherry Blossom
would be looked on with suspicion by the men
who were out.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re right,” declared Bob, eager
to know all that was passing in the active mind of
his chum.</p>

<p>“Well, you can see that this party is beckoning
as if he wanted to have us speed up our horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
still more on this sharp rise. He’s anxious to
have us join him. Can you guess why, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Say, d’ye suppose that he could have sent
that queer note?” asked the other.</p>

<p>“Just what I’ve been thinking,” replied Frank,
nodding. “Look at it yourself, and see if it
doesn’t stand to reason.”</p>

<p>“Well, so far as I can see, the fellow who
sent that letter without a signature at the bottom
would be the only one expecting somebody to
come over here from Circle Ranch,” Bob remarked.</p>

<p>“Sure. And as we get closer I’m beginning to
think I know who he is,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Someone you met when over here before, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, now I’m sure of it,” the other answered,
slowly. “His name is Sandy McCoy, and he’s
a young Scotchman who drifted to the mines a
year or so back. I remember he told me he used
to be an engineer on board a tramp steamer;
but, getting tired of the sea, he started in to
try mining.”</p>

<p>“What did you think of him at the time?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“As near as I can remember I was favorably
impressed. He seemed to be a bluff fellow, and
his eyes were as steady as a rock. On the whole,
McCoy impressed me as a man to be trusted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
My father thought the same; because he said to
me on the way home, that if he had to make a
change of overseers for any reason, he believed
that Scotchman was the chap for the job.”</p>

<p>“That was a year or more ago, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Yes, fully that; before you came, you know,”
replied the prairie boy.</p>

<p>“But there has been no occasion for a change
since then, eh?” Bob continued.</p>

<p>“Things seem to have just drifted along somehow,”
the other answered.</p>

<p>“Yet you heard grumblings every little while,
didn’t you?” Bob asked.</p>

<p>“We sure did; but anybody who has a big
gang of men working, expects that sort of thing;
and Gustave Riley seemed to know how to handle
the miners. He’s pretty much of a tyrant in
some things; but then it takes a strong hand to
manage thirty or forty rough characters, such as
we employ.”</p>

<p>“Well, it looks now pretty much as if the
cork had popped out of the bottle. If the men
have struck, the trouble is apt to be all the harder
to manage because it has held off so long,
Frank.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s right,” remarked the other,
gloomily.</p>

<p>“But see here,” Bob continued, as he watched
the actions of the lone sentinel who waited their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
coming; “McCoy doesn’t seem to be as much
tickled as he was. Fact is, Frank, he looks a bit
disappointed.”</p>

<p>At that Frank laughed a little.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “wouldn’t you, if you had
sent for help, and saw only a couple of boys coming
in answer to your letter?”</p>

<p>“Then you think he expected your father to
hurry over here with a dozen or twenty cowboys,
to help put down the rebellion?” Bob demanded.</p>

<p>“It strikes me that’s about the size of it,”
Frank assented. “But we’re nearly up to him
now, and must soon know the facts.”</p>

<p>Bob was looking at the man who waited for
them, and trying to read something of his character
from his countenance. It was a typical
Scotch face, with high cheekbones, freckles, a
red mustache and beard, and blue eyes. Bob told
himself that Sandy McCoy was an absolutely
fearless kind of man, just the sort to knock
around the world, and fill many positions that required
courage and honesty, with credit.</p>

<p>“Hello! Sandy! how are you?” called Frank,
as he and Bob drew close to the spot where the
other stood.</p>

<p>Although McCoy had a decided “burr” to his
voice, he seemed to speak decent English; and the
first thing he said was:</p>

<p>“Where’s your father, Frank?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“Back home on the ranch, nursing a broken
leg,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>The man frowned, and seemed to gnaw at his
stubby red mustache.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for that,” he remarked. “But I
suppose he sent some of the men along with ye,
Frank?”</p>

<p>Frank made a motion with his hand that included
his companion.</p>

<p>“Here’s the crowd, Sandy,” he remarked;
“just my chum, Bob Archer, and myself. His
father is interested in the Cherry Blossom along
with my dad. And we’ve come to see what the
trouble is, and try to fix things up.”</p>

<p>The other frowned, and then grinned, as he
observed quaintly:</p>

<p>“I’ve heard how in one of the battles of your
great war the Union forces were retreating in a
panic, and received reinforcements in the shape of
one man, and him General Phil Sheridan. But
he coaxed his men to face the other way, and
they won the victory. Perhaps this may be another
Cedar Creek, Frank. But it looks like a
tough proposition, boy; a tough puzzle for a lad
to work out.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s a strike on, Sandy?” questioned
Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, it came at last, after long threatening,”
replied the other. “I was just on the point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
leaving the mine, to go back to the sea, when the
storm began to show signs of breaking; so I
changed my mind, and determined to see it
through.”</p>

<p>“Are all the men against us, Sandy?” asked
Frank, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, not all,” replied the other, with a
humorous grin. “There’s the foreman, Mr.
Riley, the two water boys, one other man, and
myself standing by ye, Frank.”</p>

<p>The lad whistled, and looked at his chum.</p>

<p>“That looks pretty serious, eh, Bob?” he remarked.
“And I reckon it’ll be worse before it’s
much better. But there’s always a way out of
these things. The men have a grievance, and
Riley is inclined to be a pig-headed man. Up to
a certain point it’s a good quality in a boss; but
once in a while an overseer ought to know how
to bend a little.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Riley has done wonders here, Frank,”
remarked the Scotch engineer; “but as ye say
he’s lacking in diplomacy. I tried to advise him
how this storm might have been headed off, but
he snapped his fingers in my face. Then I thought
your father ought to get on the ground to see
for himself how matters were drifting.”</p>

<p>“You wrote that note, then, Sandy?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“You’re right, I did,” replied the other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
shrugging his shoulders, as if to say that after all
his trouble there did not seem to have been much
come from it; as an addition of two half-grown
boys would hardly help matters any.</p>

<p>“But you didn’t say as much as you might;
how was that, Sandy?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Frank,” replied the other. “You
must understand that I feel for the men in this
case. They have some cause for kicking. There
are a number of things that ought to be changed;
but Mr. Riley says no, and when he sets his face
against a thing all heaven and earth can’t make
him back water.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps there may be a way out of
that, Sandy,” remarked Frank. “From what you
say I imagine you wanted my dad on the ground,
believing that he would see what was wrong, and
change it.”</p>

<p>“He is a just man, and believes in the square
deal. Yes,” went on the other, “I wanted him
to come, and reason with the men. They are
feeling pretty bitter about it now, and it wouldn’t
take much to make them riot. The place is like
a powder magazine, where a single spark will
bring an explosion. Perhaps the very fact of
your coming may bring that result, Frank!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t think so, Sandy,” replied the
boy, smilingly. “But come, let’s head for the
mine. I want to get at the bottom of this matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
as soon as I can. You’ve been watching the trail
for an answer to the note you sent by that
Indian?”</p>

<p>“For two days, now, Frank. And all the
while the pot has kept simmering, getting hotter
and hotter. The works are shut down because
there’s no man to run the stamps. And we never
had as big a month as the last has been. I heard
Mr. Riley say it beat the record.”</p>

<p>He walked alongside Frank, talking as he
went. Bob was keenly on the alert, knowing now
that exciting events were going to happen before
long.</p>

<p>In a little while they came to the brow of a
small hill, and there, just before them, the boys
could see the straggling building that represented
one of the best paying gold mines in all Arizona.
But no sign of smoke arose above the crusher or
the stamp mill. Everywhere brooded a silence.
It seemed like the ominous hush that often precedes
the breaking of the storm.</p>

<p>Men could be seen, big brawny fellows in rough
mining costume, lounging around in small knots,
as though discussing the situation. Immediately
attention seemed to be drawn toward the three
moving figures, for hands were pointed toward
them.</p>

<p>“Listen, would you, Frank?” said Bob, as
loud cries began to be heard, while the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
started toward them, others coming out of shacks
to join the crowd.</p>

<p>Bob could not keep from viewing the coming
of the mob with more or less anxiety, for he saw
weapons being brandished; and some of the
shouts seemed to have an angry ring about them,
as though the miners might welcome a chance to
visit their wrath upon the son and heir of the
principal owner of the Cherry Blossom mine!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="fs80">STARTLING NEWS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Frank saw that the situation was a grave one.
The rough men of the mining camp naturally believed
that their demands had been refused by
the stern overseer, Mr. Riley, with the approval
of Colonel Haywood. And their anger must,
in that event, be more or less inflamed against
the principal owner of the mine.</p>

<p>Such turbulent spirits, once they got started,
would be capable of doing almost any terrible
thing in order to satisfy their desire to get even.</p>

<p>Frank, however, knew that there was a way to
manage even the most riotous crowd, provided
the men had not gone beyond all restraint. A
few half-way sensible spirits among the crowd
could sway them the right way. Here was McCoy,
who could be placed in that list; but the
question was, were there any others?</p>

<p>“McCoy,” he said to the engineer, as the
miners came trooping forward, with ominous
looks and cries, “back me up in anything that I’m
going to say. And if you happen to know of
several decent fellows among the lot, call on them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
to stand by us when the pinch comes. I’m going
to carry the day!”</p>

<p>The Scotchman looked admiringly at the boy,
as he observed quickly:</p>

<p>“Now, I wouldn’t be surprised if ye do,
Frank. Anyhow, ye can depend on Sandy McCoy
to stand by ye, come what may. And sometimes
a soft word does more than all the threats in the
wide world.”</p>

<p>“I believe you, Sandy,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>There was really little time for saying anything
more. The surging mob had by now drawn
close to them. Bob could see the ugly faces of
the men, and he found himself wondering whether
the fact of their carrying repeating rifles was going
to help matters any.</p>

<p>Frank had made not the slightest move looking
toward his gun. He sat in the saddle, and smiled,
as he waved a hand toward the approaching
miners.</p>

<p>“Hello! men,” he called out.</p>

<p>A perfect howl went up, so that if Frank had
intended saying anything more it would have been
drowned in the racket. He sat there, still smiling,
as though waiting for a chance to speak. A few
of the miners were seen to be turning on their
point, and several scowled at Sandy, as though
trying to enforce silence. Above the clamor Bob
heard one fellow say:</p>

<p>“Keep still, and let the boy have a chance!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
Give him a square deal, and listen to what he’s
got to say afore ye howl him down. Silence!”</p>

<p>By slow degrees the noise began to subside.
Some stopped shouting because they were influenced
by these arguments, and a sense of fair
play; others on account of a shortage of
breath.</p>

<p>Then the last shout died out, and silence ensued.</p>

<p>“Men,” said Frank, as firmly as he could,
though doubtless his heart was beating like a trip-hammer
under the excitement, “A good friend
of yours, Sandy McCoy here, managed to send
word to my father that there was some trouble
at the mine, and asked him to come on to talk
matters over with you, so that if anything was
wrong it might be righted.”</p>

<p>A few angry cries interrupted Frank at this
point, and several scowled at Sandy, as though
they suspected him of having sought to betray
them.</p>

<p>“Wait! Listen to what else I have to say!”
shouted Frank, holding up his hand.</p>

<p>Again those men who had asked for a fair
hearing before influenced the others, and the unruly
ones were hushed, so that the boy could
continue.</p>

<p>“My father would have come himself to meet
you, only he is suffering from a broken leg. He
sent me instead, with my chum, whose father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
also owns many shares in the good old Cherry
Blossom mine. And, men, you can see for yourselves
that we came to meet you as friends, because
we are alone. There is no armed force
back of us to threaten you. I have been sent to
hear your grievances, and if they seem to be just,
to settle the trouble here.”</p>

<p>Again all sorts of cries broke out. Some of
the men cheered; others, who feared that the
chances for rioting might be reduced to nothing,
gave evidence of their hostility. But Frank saw
with satisfaction that by a large majority the
crowd was coming to look on him in the light of
a friend, and not a foe.</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Riley?” he asked.</p>

<p>One of the men who had demanded a hearing
for the boy stepped forward.</p>

<p>“He’s barricaded himself in the engine house,”
he declared, grimly; “and says he’ll shoot down
every striker who tries to enter. I reckon the
men were only waiting for night to come to rush
his fort, and put everything to the torch!”</p>

<p>“Then it seems that I didn’t get here any too
soon,” remarked Frank. “Listen to me, men;
I’ve got full authority from my father to hear
your complaints, and to offer you a remedy, no
matter what it may cost the company. We want
our men here at the Cherry Blossom to be satisfied!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” arose many shouts, while a
few hats were thrown into the air.</p>

<p>Some of the trouble makers tried to stir up the
passion of the mob.</p>

<p>“He’s only giving you taffy, men!” they
called. “Don’t believe what the kid says. All
he wants is to hoodwink us, ’till the force from
the ranch gets within striking distance. Then
it’ll be bullets instead of soft words!”</p>

<p>But these few were quickly made to understand
they were in the minority, and that the crowd was
ready to give Frank the chance he asked for.</p>

<p>“How about the boss—Riley?” shouted one.</p>

<p>“Yes, we never can work under him again, and
there’s no use talkin’,” cried another.</p>

<p>“Wait!” said Frank. “Perhaps there may
be a change here. Perhaps my father has another
position on his ranch for Mr. Riley, and you may
have a new foreman! How would Sandy McCoy
suit you, men?” and he laid a hand on the
shoulder of the brawny young engineer as he
spoke.</p>

<p>At this the shouts that rang out were deafening.
Doubtless Gustave Riley, entrenched behind
the barricade he had erected at the engine house
of the mining camp, was sorely puzzled by the
strange sounds that came to his ears. He might
have imagined that the mutineers were getting
ready to use dynamite, in order to blow every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
building in the place to pieces, to satisfy their
desire for revenge.</p>

<p>Frank held up his hand to ask for further
silence, and when he could be heard went on:</p>

<p>“Depend on it, men, everything is going to be
made right. Stick by us, and there will be no
cause for any further trouble. If you had sent
a committee to my father before going to extremes
all this might have been avoided, because
he has the name of being a square man. Are we
going to be friends, men?”</p>

<p>Like magic the temper of the mob had changed.
Those rough men had come out filled with anger
toward Colonel Haywood and his entire family.
Now they had swung around to the other extreme.
Nearly to a man they pressed forward
to shake hands with the saddle boys. Even those
who had appeared to be ugly toward Frank
thought best to hide their real feelings and go
with the tide.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you think, Sandy?” asked
Frank, more than a little excited by the success
that had attended his peace move.</p>

<p>“It’s just wonderful how things have changed
around, Frank,” replied the other. “But would
ye mind telling me whether your father knew
what ye were going to do about makin’ a change
here in overseers?”</p>

<p>“Oh! we talked it all over, Sandy,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the boy. “He’s been convinced that a change
would do good here, and that Riley was too
severe with the men. So he is going to offer him
a fine position on the ranch, for he needs just
such a man there. I hope Riley takes the job, for
he is all right, if a little too pig-headed.”</p>

<p>“And did your father mention my name,
Frank?” asked the pleased engineer.</p>

<p>“You may be sure he did the same, Sandy.
Long ago he had his eye on you, and told me you
were going to get this billet if ever there was a
change made. But come, I’d like to talk with
the overseer. Suppose we go to the engine house,
Sandy.”</p>

<p>Frank and Bob jumped to the ground, leaving
their horses to be looked after by some of the
men, who were only too eager to curry favor this
way. Accompanied by McCoy, and followed by
two dozen of the miners, they pushed through
the camp, heading toward the buildings.</p>

<p>A head was thrust out of an opening, and a
voice hailed them.</p>

<p>“Keep back, every man of you! If a single one
crosses that dead line, I shoot!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Mr. Riley,” the miner’s son called.
“Look again, and you’ll see that it’s Frank Haywood.”</p>

<p>“Why, so it is, for a fact!” cried the prisoner
of the engine house, in a surprised tone. “Whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
brings you here, and right now when there’s
going to be all sorts of trouble breaking loose?”</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re wrong, Mr. Riley,” answered
Frank, as, accompanied by his two companions,
he continued to advance. “I’ve been
sent here by dad, whose broken leg prevented his
coming, to look into matters, and settle the same
to the satisfaction of the men.”</p>

<p>“Does that mean your father is going to give
in to them?” demanded the obstinate foreman.
“If that’s the case just count me out. I resign
on the spot. I’d fight the whole camp before I’d
knuckle down to a lot of rascals.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Riley; your resignation is accepted,”
said Frank, as the door opened, and he
stepped into the building. “My father has seen
for some time that you and the men here had bad
blood between you; and he wants you on the
ranch, if you will come, to fill a position that pays
better than being overseer at the mine.”</p>

<p>Riley, who was certainly a fighter, looked uncertain.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “it sure does make me tired
to think these plotters are going to soft-soap Colonel
Haywood; but perhaps, after all, its best.
They would burn the buildings down, and cause
a big loss. But see here, Frank, who will be boss
after I’m gone?”</p>

<p>Frank turned and looked smilingly at McCoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“Dad has had this gentleman in his eye for
some little time; how do you think he’d fill the
bill, Mr. Riley?” he asked.</p>

<p>The deposed overseer waited for a minute, as
though trying to conquer the natural feeling of
bitterness that almost overwhelmed him. Then
he impulsively thrust out his hand to Sandy.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t do better,” he said. “I honestly
believe Sandy McCoy will make good. Besides,
I reckon he’s got the confidence of the men,
and that’s what I was never able to get.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s all right, Mr. Riley,” Frank remarked.
“As you find the time, please put the
new overseer in touch with all the affairs of the
company that he ought to know. And when that
is done my father will want to see you at the
ranch.”</p>

<p>“Very good, Frank,” said Mr. Riley. “You
got here just in the nick of time. From the way
things were going I’m afraid there’d have been
warm work before another sun came up. I had
six guns back of me, with one man and two boys
to help. But now we’ll try and forget all about
the trouble. I suppose you’ll have the men get a
committee together, formulate their demands,
and then pass on ’em?”</p>

<p>“That’s about what I expect to do, Mr. Riley,”
remarked Frank, gleefully. “And since they already
trust me, I expect to have little trouble in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
patching up a lasting truce with the men of the
Cherry Blossom mine. Why, perhaps in a day
or two, my chum and I will be taking the back
trail to Circle Ranch.”</p>

<p>The deposed foreman looked around him cautiously,
and Bob was struck by something of
mystery in his actions. Then he leaned forward,
and plucked Frank by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“It might be you will not be leaving for home
as soon as you thought, Frank,” he said, suggestively.</p>

<p>“Why not, Mr. Riley; what’s to hinder us?”
asked the boy, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Why, I’m thinking that perhaps you’d feel inclined
to stay a little while longer, and see if you
couldn’t recover it,” Mr. Riley remarked.</p>

<p>“Recover what?” Frank asked.</p>

<p>“The treasure that has been stolen from the
strong room in the office of Cherry Blossom
mine,” came the astonishing reply.</p>

<p>“Treasure!” echoed Frank. “Do you mean
to tell me there has been a robbery as well as a
strike here?”</p>

<p>“Just that, Frank,” replied the other, moodily.
“All the clean-up of the month, some two hundred
pounds of gold, has been stolen, and the robbers
are by now far away from here!”</p>

<span class="fs80">TRAILING THE TREASURE THIEVES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“This is stunning news you are giving me,
Mr. Riley!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p>“I reckon it is, Frank,” replied the ex-foreman.
“And the worst of it is, that I was never able
to keep on the track of the three thieves; because
these strikers ran me into the engine house here,
and threatened me with a rope if I tried to show
up again. So I’ve been stalled for hours; and all
the time those robbers have been getting farther
and farther away.”</p>

<p>“Do you know when it happened?” asked Bob,
his lawyer nature coming to the front when the
emergency arose.</p>

<p>“Two nights ago, I’ve got good reason to believe,
from the signs,” answered Mr. Riley.</p>

<p>“But you didn’t know it right away; is that
it?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“I had so much to look after in other quarters
that I didn’t take a peep in at the strong room
until this morning. Then I was surprised to find
that the place had been cleaned out. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
about two hundred pounds of gold in three strong
sacks, and it was gone! I reckon it would add up
to something like fifty thousand dollars’ worth,
Frank!”</p>

<p>The late overseer looked haggard and glum.
He acted as though he had had a hard time of
late, with everything against him.</p>

<p>“Do you suspect any of the men employed
here?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I did, but changed my mind. There isn’t
a man missing, that I can see. I found the tracks
of the three robbers, and the marks don’t tally
with the boot-prints of any miner. They were
made by men from civilization, who wore shoes
of an up-to-date pattern.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Riley, how do you know all this,
when we found you shut up here in the engine
house?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“I hunted for the tracks after discovering the
robbery,” replied the other, moodily. “After
I had found them I trailed the three thieves half a
mile out of camp. Then, anxious to take up the
job in the right way, I came back to get some guns
and men. That was when the mob met me, and
chased me in here, where I had prepared for a
long siege.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s your opinion, is it, that three strangers
broke into the strong room, and rifled it; after
which they hurried away?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“That about covers the ground; and as they
have had a big start I’m afraid its goin’ to be a
hard job overhaulin’ ’em,” replied Mr. Riley.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it may,” said Frank, as he looked
serious; “but two hundred pounds is some weight
to carry any distance; and we have good horses,
if they happen to take to the plain.”</p>

<p>Here was a new dilemma. He had expected
that with the strike well settled, peace would descend
on Cherry Blossom mine; and that presently
he and Bob might gallop back home with cheering
news.</p>

<p>But it would be another thing to find himself
compelled to tell his father that some clever robbers
had broken open the strong room, where the
proceeds of the run at the stamp mills were kept
behind lock and key, making a safe get-away.</p>

<p>“Bob, you hear what’s been going on; how
are we going to stand for it?” Frank asked, turning
to his chum.</p>

<p>“By doing our level best to get that treasure
back!” was the prompt response.</p>

<p>“You hear, Mr. Riley,” continued Frank.
“Suppose, then, you turn things over to the new
superintendent right now, and come along with
us.”</p>

<p>“I’m just wild to get started, Frank,” declared
Mr. Riley. “Because, you see, I feel that I’m
partly to blame for this loss. But, if it hadn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
been for the upset condition of things around that
time, make up your mind it could never have
happened. My attention was taken up by the actions
of the men. Sometimes I find myself wondering
whether it just happened that way; or if
the strike wasn’t engineered to cover the crime
of robbery.”</p>

<p>“The chances are,” said Bob, deliberately,
“that if it was done by outside parties, they saw
how you were occupied by the actions of the men
in striking, and took advantage of the opportunity.”</p>

<p>“Please take us to where the rifled strong room
is, Mr. Riley,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Will you let the men know?” asked the
former superintendent.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told them, then?” queried
Frank.</p>

<p>“Not a soul knows anything about it,” came
the reply. “I was expecting to pick out a couple
of fellows, and make a start after the thieves,
when I bucked up against a snag, and they ran
me in here. But I didn’t see Sandy, and there
was no one else to take into my confidence.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think the men ought to know,” Frank
declared. “They’ll understand that I’m ready to
take them into the game; and perhaps some one
may have seen the rascals, and can give us an
idea about what they looked like. Come out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Mr. Riley, and let the crowd understand that you
don’t suspect any of them.”</p>

<p>Some dark looks were cast toward the deposed
overseer; but at least the men entertained a
healthy respect for his muscular prowess; and
nobody ever questioned his bravery. So no violence
was offered him. And as soon as Frank
told of the great robbery, everything else was immediately
forgotten.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that no one among them
was able to advance a promising clue in connection
with the robbers. So carefully had these
worthies worked that they had not been seen by
a single miner, though men had been moving
about on the entire night in question, sleep being
out of the question at the Cherry Blossom.</p>

<p>“I expect to take along Mr. Riley and one other
man, selected by him as a good trailer,” said
Frank, when the crowd gathered around him,
clamoring for a chance to do something to show
their altered feelings toward the Haywood
family.</p>

<p>“How about us, then; don’t we go along,
too?” called one husky fellow.</p>

<p>“You will stay here, and get back on your
job,” Frank remarked. “The new superintendent
will settle all troubles until I can come back.
The Cherry Blossom mine has been idle for two
days. You must work all the harder, men, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
make up for lost time. And we’re going to get
that gold back, if anybody can; understand that!”</p>

<p>Shouts greeted these words. Those rough men
could appreciate nerve, and to hear the son of
their employer talk so boldly pleased them
greatly.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Frank Haywood!” called
one big miner.</p>

<p>It thrilled the boy to hear those lusty shouts.
He felt that somehow he had succeeded in winning
a complete victory over these turbulent spirits.
Where the obstinacy of Mr. Riley had failed,
Frank’s methods had carried the day. They
were all his friends now, and just as ready to
build up as they had recently been to destroy.
The spirit of a mob changes like the weather, and
is just as fickle.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley led the two boys to the office.
Sandy McCoy lingered to address the crowd, and
try to get them to return immediately to work.</p>

<p>“Here’s the building, Frank,” remarked the
former superintendent, as they arrived in front
of a low, squat house, built of stone for the most
part, and particularly strong.</p>

<p>“Now come back with me and I will show you
just how these smart thieves tunneled under the
stone wall, and managed to come up inside the
strong room, without having the trouble to break
the lock on the door. Every time I was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
office I saw that padlock in place, and never
dreamed the bank could be empty back of that
oak door.”</p>

<p>As he said this, Mr. Riley led the way to the
rear of the building. Here it happened that
there grew more or less scrub, partly concealing
the foundation of the wall.</p>

<p>Parting this, Mr. Riley showed the boys what
looked like the big burrow of a rabbit, or a
hedgehog, running down at an angle of forty-five
degrees, so as to pass under the stones forming
the foundation of the wall.</p>

<p>“You can see how slick a game they set up,”
remarked the man, gritting his teeth with anger
and chagrin. “Perhaps they worked at this
thing more than one night, and all the time I never
tumbled to it. When the tunnel was finished, one
of ’em just crawled through, passed out the three
sacks of gold; and then they vamoosed.”</p>

<p>“Let’s look inside the house,” remarked Frank.
“Then we’ll try to arrange for following the robbers.”</p>

<p>When they entered the strong room it was to
find it empty, just as the former superintendent
had declared was the case. No sign of any treasure
could be seen.</p>

<p>“Is this your hat?” asked Bob, picking the
article in question up.</p>

<p>“Never saw it before,” answered Mr. Riley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“Then it must have belonged to one of the
thieves!” suggested the boy, examining the head
gear.</p>

<p>“Just as likely as not,” agreed the deposed
superintendent. “But that isn’t goin’ to help us
find out who they are, and where they can be run
across right now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” observed Bob, as he again examined
the soft, felt hat, which was of a gray
color, with a black band around the crown, the
whole forming a combination that would have
been fairly noticeable.</p>

<p>“There’s nearly an hour before dark sets in,”
Frank observed, “and perhaps we might get a
start. Suppose you hunt up the best all-round
trailer in the camp, Mr. Riley, and fetch him
along. Have you horses that could be used?
We might want to travel some distance, especially
if the trail heads toward the Mexican border.”</p>

<p>“All right, Frank,” replied the other, seeming
to brighten up at the chance for doing something.
“I’ll be back in a little while, and we’ll make a
start. If you want to look for yourself, hike over
to where you see the broken rocks in a heap.
Right alongside you’ll find the tracks of the robbers.
We’ll fetch all the horses along.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Riley hurried away to carry out his
part of the plan; while Frank and Bob walked
over to where the rocks lay, looking very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
like a grave, in the valley where the Cherry Blossom
mine was being worked.</p>

<p>“Here they are, just as he said,” remarked
Frank, as he dropped down on hands and knees,
the better to examine the tracks left by the marauders.</p>

<p>“What do you make of them?” asked Bob,
presently, as his chum arose again.</p>

<p>“Oh! just as Mr. Riley said; there were three
in the bunch,” Frank answered.</p>

<p>“How about their shoes—can you tell whether
they’re smaller than the boots worn by the
miners?” Bob continued, as if desirous of making
sure.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a fact, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Then it stands to reason he was right when
he said the robbery had been done by strangers
here,” the Kentucky boy went on to say.</p>

<p>“Looks that way,” Frank agreed. “Perhaps
they came from Phoenix; or even far-away Los
Angeles. The story of the rich Cherry Blossom
has traveled far and wide; and I suppose these
three rascals made up a plot to get away with the
month’s run.”</p>

<p>“And they did it, all right,” remarked Bob.
“Think you can follow the tracks, Frank?”</p>

<p>“The easiest thing ever,” came the reply.
“Besides, right here Mr. Riley left his big footprints,
so a blind man could keep on the trail.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Come on, we might as well be moving. Plenty
of time later on for a rest, when perhaps the
dark will keep us from work.”</p>

<p>Frank led off as he spoke. He had learned his
lesson fairly well, from having lived among cowboys
for years. Besides, old Hank Coombs, the
veteran cowman of the Circle Ranch, had often
showed the son of his employer many tricks in
connection with woodcraft.</p>

<p>A short time later Frank turned again to speak
to his comrade.</p>

<p>“Here’s as far as Riley went,” he observed.
“See, he swung off at this point, just as he told
us, meaning to get several men with guns to go
along with him. But instead he ran up against
the mob rioters, who forced him to barricade himself
in the engine house.”</p>

<p>“That was some hours ago,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true,” Frank replied.</p>

<p>“Lots of things could happen in that time,
Frank.”</p>

<p>“Sure they could; but all the same there’s only
one thing we’ve got to do, and that is to keep
right on this trail till it brings us up with the three
thieves; or else we’ll lose it in the mountains.”</p>

<p>He again started along the tracks of the fugitives.
Bob followed close behind, where he could
speak when the humor seized him, and ask questions;
for Bob knew he had much to learn about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
the wonderful things a prairie boy knows by
heart; and he never hesitated to make inquiries.</p>

<p>“How old did Mr. Riley say this trail was,
Frank?” he presently asked.</p>

<p>“Nearly two days; but it’s nearly as plain as
when it was made; and if he can fetch along a man
worth shucks, we oughtn’t to have any trouble
about following.”</p>

<p>“Well, here comes our friend, Mr. Riley, and
he’s got a bunch of horses along; besides another
man,” Bob remarked; as he looked back over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Frank, though he did not
cease his efforts to follow the plainly-marked trail.</p>

<p>Presently they were overtaken by Mr. Riley
and the other man, whom he introduced as Sim
Garrison, once something of a noted character
among the Indians, with whom he had lived many
years, and who, the former superintendent declared,
had no superior as a trailer.</p>

<p>“All we’ve got to do, boys,” said Mr. Riley,
who was mounted on a big and powerful bay
horse, and seemed to be heavily armed, “is to
plug along behind Sim, leaving him to do the
work. If the time should ever come when we
could overtake those three thieves, then we’ll have
a chance to show our hands.”</p>

<p>And that was what they started out to do, as
the sun sank lower and lower in the glowing west.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
Through the basin or valley in which the famous
mine lay, they pushed.</p>

<p>“Seems to know his business, all right,” commented
Bob, as he ranged alongside his chum; the
two horses had been relieved of much of their
loads so that they felt fresher than when the boys
arrived, a short time before.</p>

<p>“I reckon yes,” replied Frank, who had been
observing Sim Garrison closely for some little
time. “And these experienced trailers can even
follow the track of a man on the darkest night,
you know.”</p>

<p>“You mean by the use of a lantern or a torch?”
remarked Bob. “I can well believe that, because
already I’ve seen you do the same stunt.
These fellows may get away from us, Frank, but
they’ve got to hustle to do it, let me tell you.”</p>

<p>“That’s what, Bob. But look at Sim halting
now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s run up against a snag already.
You’ve often told me there are lots of ways to
hide a trail; perhaps these sharp thieves have
done that same thing!” Bob ventured to remark.</p>

<p>“But all the same I don’t believe so,” Frank
went on, as he urged the led horse which the
trailer was to ride later on, to increase its speed
from a walk to a little canter.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” demanded his chum, quickly,
with the air of “if you know all that just communicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
a little of it to a tenderfoot like me, can’t
you, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, just because he doesn’t happen to
look disappointed, for one thing. He’s found
something that surprised him more or less. But
we’ll soon know, Bob.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="fs80">THE PATH ALONG THE CLIFF</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A long, loud whistle sounded.</p>

<p>“What d’ye suppose that’s for?” asked Bob.
“It came from the mine, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” replied Frank. “And I reckon
it’s a call for the men to get busy.”</p>

<p>“That would mean the new overseer is starting
things again?” continued Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, it looks that way, as sure as anything,”
his chum went on, with an air of satisfaction.
“So we can take it for granted that the men believe
things are going to come out all right; which
they will, if I can make ’em.”</p>

<p>By this time they had arrived close to the spot
where the trailer stood awaiting their arrival.
As Mr. Riley had kept closer to Sim than had
either of the boys, he was even then on the
ground, looking down at something to which his
attention had evidently been directed by the other.</p>

<p>Frank threw himself down, giving his chum
the horses to care for.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Why, it seems as if another trail, much
fresher, has crossed the one we were following,”
replied the former overseer.</p>

<p>“Why does that bother him?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Just because Sim, here, declares the tracks
are so much like some of those made by the men
we’re chasing after, that he believes they must be
the same parties!” Mr. Riley answered.</p>

<p>“Oh! that changes the case a heap,” remarked
Frank. “Let me take a look and see if I can tell
as much.”</p>

<p>A minute later he got up off his knees.</p>

<p>“How?” asked Bob, Indian fashion.</p>

<p>“Sim is dead right,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>“Same lot, then, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Not a little doubt about it,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Three men, and all wearing store shoes, with
narrow soles, eh?” Bob continued.</p>

<p>Frank shot a look toward the experienced
trailer. Then he held up two fingers of his right
hand, with a question in his eyes. Sim nodded
his head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“There seems to be only two of them now,”
remarked Frank.</p>

<p>“One missing, eh?” Bob kept on. “What
d’ye suppose they could have done with him?”</p>

<p>“What do <em>you</em> think, Mr. Riley?” and Frank
turned on the ex-superintendent.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he reflectively, “I’ve seen many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
of these fellows in my days, boys, and I reckon I
know about how they pan out. There was just
three in the bunch to start. That was evidently
one too many. It made the shares of the swag
too small. What happens? Oh! they just lost
the third man, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“What! Do you mean to say they disposed
of him when he wasn’t looking, and then ran away
with the treasure?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know,” resumed the ex-overseer.
“Perhaps it wa’n’t so bad as that. They might
have only tumbled him down into some hole, and
left him there to climb out, or stay in. Then
again, perhaps they just held him up, took his
guns away, and then walked off with his sack.”</p>

<p>“That sounds as if it might be the way it happened,”
remarked Bob, who could, in imagination,
almost see the treachery of the two robbers being
carried out; and, while he did not know why it
should be so, somehow his sympathy seemed to go
out to the third man who was being so badly
treated by his mates.</p>

<p>“But you said the gold must have weighed in
the neighborhood of two hundred pounds, didn’t
you, Mr. Riley?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Not far from that, Frank, and valued at
nearly fifty thousand dollars, counting it at about
twenty dollars to the ounce, and twelve ounces to
the pound,” replied the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“That looks queer,” mused Frank.</p>

<p>“In what way?” asked Bob, quickly; while
both the others listened eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, you told me the gold was in three sacks,
didn’t you?” Frank went on.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Then if these two fellows were carrying it all,
one of them would have to tote two of the sacks,
wouldn’t he?” the boy demanded.</p>

<p>“It stands to reason he would, because they
couldn’t divide the third bag,” Riley admitted,
readily enough.</p>

<p>“All right. Now when a fellow staggers along
carrying one hundred and thirty pounds on his
back he would be sure to sink into the soft ground
much deeper than when he only had half that
much, eh, Mr. Riley?” Frank continued.</p>

<p>The man gave utterance to an exclamation;
while the experienced trailer dropped once more
to the ground.</p>

<p>“The boy’s right, Riley,” the last individual
exclaimed, almost immediately. “The cross
tracks are as fresh as if made only a little time
ago; while the others are old, but if anything, the
new ones are not as deep as the first!”</p>

<p>“What would you take from that?” demanded
Bob.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they hid the gold!” suggested Mr.
Riley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Looks that way; though for the life of me I
can’t understand why they’ve been a-hangin’
around here all this time, takin’ chances,” Sim
Garrison said.</p>

<p>“Then what ought we do?” remarked the
former superintendent, turning to Frank. “Keep
right along after the two thieves; or turn back
on this new trail, and try to find where they hid
the stuff?”</p>

<p>Frank had to think fast just then. A mistake
was apt to prove costly.</p>

<p>“We can always come back to this point, and
take up the back trail,” he said; “but the thieves
will be getting farther and farther away all the
while. So I say, let’s start after them.”</p>

<p>“I cover that way,” remarked Sim. “Seems
like no fellers’d ever come up into this country
without mounts; and I just reckon that these two
are headin’ for where the hosses are hid.”</p>

<p>“Then the sooner we start, the better chance
we will have to get sight of them,” Frank remarked.</p>

<p>Sim took the hint. Bending down he hastened
along. So accustomed were his eyes to picking
out signs invisible to a greenhorn like Bob, that
he was able to run pretty much all the time; and
the horses had to keep up a little canter to hold
their own.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether we will really get a glimpse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
of them before night sets in?” Bob remarked,
as he rode along close to his chum.</p>

<p>“Nobody can tell,” came the reply; “but it
wouldn’t surprise me if we did. What I’m wondering
at is why these fellows hung around all
this time, when they must have known there would
be a hunt as soon as the robbery was discovered.”</p>

<p>“That <em>is</em> queer, come to think of it,” Bob
agreed. “And you don’t happen to think of
any explanation, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I don’t,” Frank admitted, shaking
his head. “Of course I could give a dozen
guesses; but all of ’em would be far from the
mark. Still, there must be a reason, and a mighty
good one, too. A whole lot might hinge on a
little thing.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they just happened to cross
their old trail?” Bob asked.</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” came the ready reply; “and
see how accident helps a fellow, sometimes. Only
for that we’d have been forced to follow them
over all the ground they’ve covered since the robbery
took place two nights ago. That helped us
along fine.”</p>

<p>“And that’s how hard luck sometimes upsets
all the calculations of the sharpest of rascals,” remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Seems like it,” observed Frank, and immediately
afterwards he cried out: “Look up yonder;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
what’s that moving there? I’m nearly sure
I saw a horse pass that little gap, Mr. Riley.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you did, Frank!” exclaimed Sim,
the trailer; “and there goes a second one. Off
we go, fellers, and it’s a stern chase now!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure they’re the men we’re looking
for?” gasped Bob, as Domino sprang after the
horses ridden by the ex-superintendent and Sim.</p>

<p>“Everything seems to point that way,” replied
Frank. “They’re running as if scared at sight
of us; and that’s almost a sure evidence of guilt.
Then, as near as I can tell, the two men seem to
be anything but miners. I reckon we’ve put up
our game, all right. And already we’re pulling
up on ’em some.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” declared Bob. “They happen
to have poor mounts. Why, I can see one of
the horses limp even from here. But, Frank,
isn’t it likely those fellows will put up a stiff fight
before surrendering to us?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if they did, Bob.
Now look at them turn that bend, and disappear
from sight. Seems as if the trail runs along a
path that’s fastened to the face of the cliff; doesn’t
it? A slip would mean trouble for man and
horses. But if <em>they</em> can make it, <em>we</em> ought to be
able to.”</p>

<p>“Where they lead we follow!” cried Bob,
much excited by this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>They were soon sweeping along close to the
dangerous place in the trail. Sim was in the van,
for since he had been installed in the place of
honor as tracker, it was only right he should
assume the lead. Next to him came Mr. Riley;
then Frank, while Bob brought up in the rear.</p>

<p>“Say, Frank, did you happen to see the sacks
of treasure hung on the animals?” asked the Kentucky
boy.</p>

<p>“Not that I knew of; did you?” demanded
the other quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I didn’t, that’s a fact,” replied
Bob. “But then, they might have them concealed.
They would expect to meet lots of white
people on the road after they had gone a certain
distance. There, Sim is turning the bend in the
path along the face of the cliff. Ugh! don’t look
down, or you’ll get dizzy. It’s awful deep right
here. One little slip, and where would you
land?”</p>

<p>Hardly had Bob made this suggestive remark,
calculated to give Frank a shiver, than their ears
were saluted by a heavy explosion right ahead
around the bend.</p>

<p>A portion of the cliff path seemed to separate
itself from the rock wall, and go plunging down;
and Sim, together with his horse, was carried over
the edge with it!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<span class="fs80">SIM HAS A CLOSE CALL</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Oh!” cried Bob, who had just caught a fleeting
glimpse of man and rider tottering on the
verge of the broken cliff trail, which had evidently
been blown away by the explosion of a dynamite
cartridge placed there for that purpose by the retreating
fugitives, in order to cut off pursuit.</p>

<p>Frank saw more.</p>

<p>He knew that Sim, being an old cowman, and
accustomed to leaving his saddle in a hurry when
some peril threatened, had shaken his feet free
from the stirrups. One wild spring, and the
trail-finder managed to clutch hold of the rock,
though his horse went plunging down into space.</p>

<p>Frank was out of his own saddle in a second.
Another, and he had snatched the rope which he
always carried, to be used as a lariat when chasing
steers, or a means of keeping his horse from
straying too far away at night.</p>

<p>Buckskin seemed to know that this was no time
for any prancing. He behaved himself splendidly.
On the other hand the big bay of the
former superintendent gave evidence of fright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
jumping up, apparently desirous of trying to turn
around, an impossible feat on that narrow shelf,
or at least one accompanied by extreme hazard.</p>

<p>Frank knew then that it all depended on him,
if Sim was to be rescued. He could see that the
man was still dangling there, his only hold being
the tip of the rock. At any moment his grip
might loosen, and he would be hurled down after
his horse, that lay motionless more than eighty
feet below.</p>

<p>Frank watched his chance, and managed to slip
past the rearing steed of Mr. Riley, without being
struck by the flying hoofs.</p>

<p>Now he was close above Sim. One glance told
the boy that he could not hope to bend down and
catch hold of the man. His rope would have to
be used; but just how he could place the loop was
a question, with both arms of the man held aloft.</p>

<p>Sim solved the puzzle for him by elevating his
legs, bent at the knee. Instantly Frank knew
what he wanted him to do—drop the loop of his
lariat over both legs, and then draw taut. In
case Sim’s grip was broken, while he might hang
head downward, at least he could not take that
terrible plunge.</p>

<p>Frank was a pretty good hand at throwing the
rope, and those upturned legs offered so easy a
mark that he could hardly fail to drop the noose
over them at the first attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>When this had been accomplished his next
movement was to whip the rope around a point
of rock that jutted out close at hand. It was the
same action that a cowboy would bring into play
in snubbing a steer he had roped.</p>

<p>“Great!” cried Bob, who had watched all this
with eyes that seemed to be fairly bulging from
his head.</p>

<p>But there was still more to be done. Sim had
managed to secure only a makeshift grip on the
rock. His hands were slipping by degrees,
though he had held on with desperation until he
felt the rope drawn taut, and knew that Frank
had made fast above.</p>

<p>Then he let go!</p>

<p>Bob gave an involuntary cry. He could not
help it, even while understanding how this emergency
had been provided against by his chum who
used the rope.</p>

<p>“Somebody give me a hand!” called Frank,
who had hold of the lariat close to where it had
been several times wound around the projecting
stone.</p>

<p>Bob dropped out of the saddle. Really, considering
the fact that this sort of business was
quite new to him, the black Kentucky horse was
acting very well. Perhaps Domino took pattern
from his companion, Buckskin. At any rate
he did not prance wildly, after the fashion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
big bay ridden by Mr. Riley; and Bob afterwards
declared that he was quite proud of his mount.</p>

<p>Of course, once the two stout boys bent to the
task, they quickly drew the dangling Sim to the
top of the wall, so that he could scramble on
to the cliff path. Outside of being red in the
face, from his having hung head downward, the
ex-cowboy seemed none the worse for his experience.</p>

<p>But he was in a pretty heated condition mentally.
To his mind that trick played by the two
fugitives was the meanest thing ever heard of.
Frank, of course, understood that the main object
had been to destroy the cliff path, so as to cut
off pursuit. That the explosion had been delayed
a little longer than calculated on, was only an
accident.</p>

<p>“I’m out of the game by it, anyhow!” grumbled
Sim, as he crawled to the edge, to look down
to where his late mount lay.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do now?” asked Bob,
who once more had hold of the bridle of his
horse, though he did not try to mount.</p>

<p>“The game didn’t work, fellers,” called Sim,
who had changed his position, and was now examining
the break in the path. “Looky here,
there’s enough footing left to get the hosses over,
with a little care.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” remarked Mr. Riley, now also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
dismounted, his big bay acting more tractably.
“I reckon I can coax old Brickdust here to amble
over. Come along, you skittish rascal, and show
your good points.”</p>

<p>Bob fairly held his breath as he watched how
the former superintendent of the mine first
stepped along the narrow ledge himself, and,
holding the bridle, urged his steed to do the
same.</p>

<p>One little misstep, and nothing could keep the
horse from toppling over the ridge, just as Sim’s
unlucky mount had done. There was some snorting
on the part of the big bay; but the animal
seemed to appreciate the situation. Keeping as
close to the face of the wall of stone as possible,
and stepping carefully, Brickdust crossed the
broken spot in the cliff trail.</p>

<p>“Sim, you help Bob get his mount over,” said
Frank, as he started to follow the example of Mr.
Riley.</p>

<p>Of course Buckskin gave no trouble. He had
been brought up amid such wild surroundings,
and was as sure-footed as a mountain goat. Besides,
doubtless during the innumerable gallops
taken by Frank, they had frequently been compelled
to navigate ticklish paths, where a slip
meant disaster; so the horse was used to such
things.</p>

<p>“Let me have the bridle; and you go ahead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Bob, so your hoss kin keep his eye on ye,” said
Sim.</p>

<p>Bob noticed how the other failed to wind the
bridle around his wrist. On the contrary Sim
held it in such a way that he could let go instantly,
should Domino act frightened while in the danger
zone. Nor could the ex-cowboy be blamed for
such caution. One experience was quite enough
for him. And a drop into that yawning gulf was
almost sure death.</p>

<p>Domino proved a sensible horse. He stepped
carefully, and snorted as though appreciating the
situation; but he managed to get over to the wider
ledge without once slipping.</p>

<p>Bob breathed easy again. Had anything happened
he must have felt heavy-hearted for a long
time; because the black animal seemed to enter
into his very life, such were the warm associations
between them.</p>

<p>“Sorry to lose you, Sim!” exclaimed Mr.
Riley, as he once more climbed into his saddle,
ready to take up the pursuit.</p>

<p>“And I’m all knocked to pieces by my misfortune!”
grumbled the trailer. “Hope ye have
good luck, Mr. Riley, an’ fetch the stuff back
again. So-long, boys!”</p>

<p>They were off again, leaving Sim there on the
shelf, waving them good-by.</p>

<p>Both Frank and Mr. Riley were on the lookout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
for signs of those whom they were chasing. Even
Bob strained his eyes to catch some glimpses of
them, though he hardly knew in which direction
to look.</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of them, Frank?”
he asked, presently, when he urged his horse
alongside Buckskin.</p>

<p>“Sure,” came the confident reply. “Several
times I’ve caught sight of the pair. They’re
whipping up to beat the band; but we seem to be
gaining all the while.”</p>

<p>“Must have surprised ’em to see us, after they
played such a clever game to cut off all pursuit,
eh?” went on his chum.</p>

<p>“That’s a fact, Bob; they expected that dynamite
to smash the whole trail, and leave a gap
no horse could pass over. But it failed to do its
work, even if Sim did lose his horse, and come
near going down himself.”</p>

<p>“Whew! but it was some ticklish when that explosion
came,” remarked Bob, with a little whistle.
“I’ll never forget it as long as I live. I thought
Domino would sure stand up on his hind legs, and
try to wheel around. That would have wound
me up, and both of us must have gone over the
edge. Excuse me from chasing after a couple of
treasure thieves along a path that is hung in the
air.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re nearly out of this end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
mountains now, and there they go off on the level
plain,” Frank remarked, pointing with his right
hand.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a stern chase then,” declared
his chum.</p>

<p>“Looks like it, Bob; but the one thing I don’t
like is that night will be down on us in short
order now. We don’t have long twilight in the
Southwest, you know. And while there ought to
be a pretty fair moon, I notice that clouds are
swarming up over yonder, so that in less than
half an hour its going to be some dark.”</p>

<p>Bob looked up at the sky, then toward the distant
fugitives, and shook his head, as if the situation
did not exactly appeal to him.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE LONG CHASE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Frank, you don’t think it’s going to storm,
do you?” asked Bob, a little later.</p>

<p>At that the other laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“Oh! I see what’s on your mind, old fellow!”
he exclaimed. “You’re thinking of what happened
to us when we were lost on Thunder Mountain,
and a cloudburst came near catching us in
the canyon. But no such danger here, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad of that, anyhow,” retorted the
other; “because I’m not extra fond of storms myself;
and down here in this queer country they
carry on in a way I’m not used to. But suppose
dark comes down on us, as you say it’s bound to
do soon, and we’re still a long distance behind
those fellows—what then?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Riley will have to decide,” returned
Frank, willing that an older head than his should
take the lead in such an emergency.</p>

<p>“But if we don’t see the rascals, how can we
keep after ’em?” persisted Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh! well, we might get a general idea of how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
they were heading all the time, and keep pushing
on, in hopes we would overtake ’em sooner or
later. The chances would be slim, of course; but
anything is better than lying idle. But wait till
Mr. Riley makes up his mind.”</p>

<p>As they rode on, the sun vanished from view.
Night would come upon them more quickly than
usual on account of those gathering clouds.</p>

<p>“We seem to keep gaining all the time,
Frank,” remarked Bob, after another fifteen
minutes had passed.</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” replied his chum; “and it
makes me feel bad because I don’t happen to be
an up-to-date Joshua, so I could hold the sun still
for an hour more, up in the Western sky. Given
that much time, and we’d overhaul ’em, dead
sure.”</p>

<p>“I reckon we would,” declared Bob, “because
even a greenhorn like myself can see how one of
those horses has a little limp; and the other is
forced to hold back to keep him company. Well,
it’s been a lively chase, anyway, even if we don’t
overtake the fellows. We’re given ’em a bad
scare, and that’s one consolation.”</p>

<p>They kept pushing on steadily over the plains
as the minutes crept past.</p>

<p>“It’s a great pity our horses were stale after
an all day ride, when this thing started out,” remarked
Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what I was saying to myself a little bit
ago,” Frank replied.</p>

<p>“If it had been morning, now,” the Kentucky
boy sighed, “with Buckskin and Domino fresh,
wouldn’t we just eat up the ground, though, and
climb after those fellows? Why, we’d leave that
big bay of Mr. Riley’s out of sight.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” added Frank; “why, even as it
is, we hold our own with the bay; and he was
fresh to start with.”</p>

<p>This gave Bob more or less consolation. Anything
that stamped his pet as a horse of unusual
quality, was sure to give him pleasure.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost ’em, Frank!” he called out, some
little time later, after he had been straining his
eyes to the limit in the endeavor to make out the
moving figures ahead.</p>

<p>“And <em>I</em> expect to very soon now,” his chum
answered, bending forward in the saddle while
speaking, as though he dared not remove his gaze
for even one second from the dimly-seen objects
beyond.</p>

<p>“Gone!” called Mr. Riley, still ahead of the
others.</p>

<p>None of them drew up. Frank believed he
could still see the fugitives. One of them happened
to be mounted on a gray horse, and this
moving object held in view even after the darker
animal had been blotted out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>Presently, however, even Frank was compelled
to admit that he could not positively say he could
see anything.</p>

<p>He and Mr. Riley exchanged occasional remarks
concerning the course. Both of them had
taken their bearings by means of the heavens.
The rising wind was also a guide, for it struck
them full in the face; though for that matter it
might not be wholly depended on, since it was
liable to whip around to some other point of the
compass.</p>

<p>Bob was riding a little way behind the others.
Truth to tell, the Kentucky boy had reached a
point where he was compelled to confess, to himself
of course, that he was feeling rather tired.</p>

<p>The day had been very hot, and some of their
riding of an arduous character, particularly the
mountain-climbing part. Still, Bob was possessed
of a very determined nature, and would not easily
give in. When he felt a pain shoot through any
portion of his body, he shut his teeth harder, and
took himself to task.</p>

<p>“Want people to think you’re a baby, Bob
Archer?” he would mutter, as he took a firmer
grip on the bridle, and shook it to let Domino
know he was awake to the occasion. “As long
as Frank can stand it, you should; and you’ve just
got to; hear that?”</p>

<p>The darkness had settled down all around them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
in earnest now. Bob was unable to see anything
ahead beyond the forms of his two comrades,
separated by some thirty feet.</p>

<p>Far off he could make out the tops of the mountains,
outlined blackly against the cloudy heavens;
but on the plain itself all was a pall of darkness.</p>

<p>One thing gave Bob considerable uneasiness.
He feared that they might have the bad luck to
run foul of a prairie dog village, such as could be
occasionally found on these level stretches of the
plains. Stories of horses having their legs broken
by stepping into such a burrow, while going at top
speed, had been common among the cow punchers
of Circle Ranch; and Bob had often dreaded lest
Domino meet that fate some unfortunate day
or night.</p>

<p>That was really one reason why he lagged behind,
so that if trouble came to his comrades he
might have ample warning, and check the progress
of his horse in time. There was no need of
sacrificing Domino without anything to gain by it;
and Bob could be a little selfish on account of his
horse, where he would scorn to adopt safe
measures for himself.</p>

<p>Once or twice Bob fancied he caught some
sound in the distance. On second thought, however,
he realized that it could not possibly come
from those they followed. The soft ground
would prevent the beat of their horses’ hoofs being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
heard any distance; and they were still undoubtedly
far away.</p>

<p>Bob, changing his mind about keeping at such a
distance in the rear, urged Domino to shorten the
gap; for he was getting lonely and wished to have
an occasional word with his chum.</p>

<p>“About how long can we keep up this going,
Frank?” he questioned, as soon as he had arrived
within speaking distance of the leading
pair.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” answered the one addressed;
“that depends on how our horses hold out. Does
Domino show any signs of lagging, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Well, he must be tired, after such a long
day’s trip, and then this gallop thrown in for good
measure,” replied Bob; “but he’s got the grit to
keep along with the rest. Honest now, Frank, it
wouldn’t surprise me if Mr. Riley’s big bay was
the first to show signs of distress.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right, boy,” admitted the ex-superintendent,
with a chuckle. “I’m not the best
judge of horses, like Sim was; but I can tell a fine
one when I see him. And this here bay doesn’t
hold a candle to either of the others. Still, he’s
good for some little time yet, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Bob had to keep a tight rein, for there was
always a chance of a horse stumbling. The long,
dead grass that covered the plain, was matted in
places, so that it formed little traps for flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
feet. It was Frank who had warned him against
this ever-present peril.</p>

<p>He found himself wondering what the two
fugitives in the advance might be doing. Would
they imagine that their pursuers had dropped off
with the coming of darkness; and take things so
easily that, after a time, those who were following
might come up with them?</p>

<p>It was while this thought was passing through
Bob’s mind that he heard Frank give a sudden
exclamation. Immediately he looked ahead, to
see a light flash up; and then came a second, over
to the left a little distance.</p>

<p>“Why, Frank, are they going to camp?” he
asked, in surprise; “and how odd of them to make
such big fires. They ought to know we’d see
them!”</p>

<p>“You’re away off, Chum Bob!” exclaimed
Frank, with annoyance in his voice. “Those are
not camp fires at all. The smart rascals have
taken advantage of the rising wind, and the long
dead grass. They’ve fired the prairie, hoping to
cut off pursuit!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<span class="fs80">THE PRAIRIE FIRE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Frank’s words gave his chum a new thrill.</p>

<p>Although he had been in the Southwest nearly
a year now, Bob had never seen a prairie fire.
Of course he had heard many stories connected
with such events, as some of the adventurous
cowboys stirred up their memories. And,
like all greenhorns, Bob had naturally conceived
a great respect, amounting almost to awe, for a
conflagration on the boundless plain.</p>

<p>He noted how quickly the fire seemed to spread.
It ran along almost like magic, and what looked
like an insignificant blaze one minute, in another
was a roaring bank of flame, driven forward by
the whipping wind.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley had pulled in his horse almost immediately.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t get there in time to cross before
it would be hot enough to scorch our hair off,
Frank!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Bob expected that the only thing left for them
to do would be to turn back over the plains and
head once more for the shelter of the mountains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
from which they had so recently come. And with
tired horses to depend on, the chances of their
being speedily overtaken by that bounding wall of
fire were pretty strong.</p>

<p>But Frank knew something about these things.
He had listened to many tales of men who had
been caught in such a trap; and how they had
managed to escape destruction by some clever
move.</p>

<p>“Notice the wind, that it’s a little off to one
side!” he called out.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so, Frank,” replied Mr. Riley,
knowing full well that the prairie boy must have
some plan in view when he said this, and quite
ready to join in with him in following that plan
out.</p>

<p>“Our only chance lies in trying to outride the
fire to the west!” cried Frank. “It’s eating that
way slowly, and perhaps we can make it, so as to
pass around that end. Come along, and make the
horses do their prettiest now!”</p>

<p>With that they were off on the jump. Little
need to dig their heels into the heaving sides of
the animals. The sight of the fire, increasing
in size constantly, as the wind carried the flames
into new territory, was enough to excite the flagging
energies of the three horses; and they rushed
along at a pace that was little short of remarkable,
considering their tired condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>Bob would not let Domino fall behind, even
had the black failed to show sufficient energy on
his own account. It seemed to the Kentucky lad
that once he became separated from his friends he
must be overwhelmed in that dreadful fire.</p>

<p>Of course, since they were now galloping almost
along the front of the blaze, it was constantly
drawing closer to them. Bob could feel
the increasing heat. It struck upon his face, and
was entirely different from the sensation he had
experienced because of the warmth of the day.
This was dry, scorching. He could easily imagine
what a fierce temperature there must be in the
midst of that sizzling, dead grass.</p>

<p>Being entirely unaccustomed to judging anything
of this nature, poor Bob conceived the idea
that they would not be able to get beyond the
outer edge of the long line of fire before it swept
down upon them.</p>

<p>“Can we make it, Frank?” he shouted; for
there was by this time quite a roaring sound in
the air; as well as stifling smoke that made the
eyes smart and breathing difficult.</p>

<p>“Sure we will, Bob; make up your mind to
that; but keep digging at your horse for all you’re
worth!” Frank answered, trying to speak cheerily;
for he realized just how fearful the spectacle
must appear in the eyes of a tenderfoot who had
never witnessed anything like it before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Possibly Frank himself might not have been
quite as confident as he pretended. He must
surely know how any delay, even of seconds, was
likely to play havoc with the best laid plans. And
one of a dozen things might happen, if bad luck
followed them.</p>

<p>Time was measured in moments just then.
Bob, in fact, counted it by heart beats; for something
seemed to be pounding against his ribs at a
furious rate, which he supposed must be his excited
heart.</p>

<p>He noted that they were drawing near the end
of the fire line; but at the same time the fact of
the conflagration being close to them was made
evident by the increased heat.</p>

<p>“Faster yet!” called Frank, bringing down
his hand on the flank of Buckskin, in true cowboy
manner; and the pony responded gallantly to
this urgent demand.</p>

<p>Could Domino rise to the occasion, and make a
last spurt? Bob imitated the example of the
others, and slapped the flank of his black, at the
same time giving the most tremendous yell of
which he was capable.</p>

<p>He knew at once that the ruse had succeeded,
for Domino seemed fairly to fly over the yielding
turf.</p>

<p>If only no unfortunate accident befell them,
the goal was bound to be reached. And once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
around to the rear of the fire, the danger would
be past.</p>

<p>So Bob’s spirits rose again, for he was naturally
of a buoyant nature. Besides, at the extreme
end of the fire line the flames did not seem to be
quite so fierce as in the middle. They had to eat
up against the breeze, after a fashion.</p>

<p>One last spurt, and they passed the barrier, although
compelled to turn their faces the other
way on account of the heat.</p>

<p>Bob expected his comrades to give vent to their
satisfaction in loud yells. To his surprise they did
nothing of the sort. More than that, Frank immediately
called out to him, saying:</p>

<p>“Don’t whoop it up, Bob! To do that would
only let ’em know we’d managed to flank the
blaze, and were still after them. As it is, they’ll
believe we’re either caught in the fire, or running
before it to beat the band!”</p>

<p>Then Bob saw why silence was the best policy,
just then. And more than ever he admired the
ready way in which his chum was able to grasp
all parts of the game.</p>

<p>The horses were breathing hard, after their
recent strain. Bob patted Domino on his wet
neck with the true affection a lover of horses feels
for the animal that has successfully borne him
through a race.</p>

<p>“Good old Domino!” he said, again and again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
“No fellow ever had a braver mount! And I
know I’ll never meet with your equal in a life
time. Bully boy! there never yet was a time
when I called on you for an extra spurt but what
you had it tied up and waiting. Whew! that was
a close shave, though! I reckon my eyebrows
must have been singed some!”</p>

<p>Frank and Mr. Riley had again taken an observation.
Little use to look up to the dome
overhead to get their course, because the clouds
completely covered the sky. But the direction of
the wind told them what they wanted to know; so
that once again the three horses were headed into
the Southwest.</p>

<p>“Say, Frank, I was thinking that perhaps they
might be able to see us even when we couldn’t get
a glimpse of them,” called out Bob, who was close
in the rear.</p>

<p>“That’s true for you, Bob,” answered the
other; “because the fire makes a bright background.
But we have to take those chances.
Once let us get sight of them, and we’ll bring this
thing to an end soon enough.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what’s next?” Bob was saying to
himself.</p>

<p>The fact was, he had experienced so many
strange things during the last three months, that
he was beginning to believe the list must be almost
inexhaustible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>No wonder, then, that Bob found himself
wondering what he would run across next. It
began to seem as if almost anything could happen
in this strange country, so different from that surrounding
his Kentucky home.</p>

<p>They kept on for another hour.</p>

<p>The fire had passed off far to the eastward.
Possibly it would only be halted when it reached
the bank of the river which lay in that direction.</p>

<p>By this time the horses were showing unmistakable
signs of fatigue, such as none of the three riders
could ignore.</p>

<p>“We must pull up soon, Frank,” Bob remarked,
when he found how reluctantly his mount
responded to his further appeals. “Poor
Domino is about all in, and I’m not going to
break him for all the gold thieves in Arizona.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what Mr. Riley and myself were
saying, Bob,” replied the other, as he checked his
own horse, and brought his lagging lope down
into first a canter, and then a plain walk. “We
happen to be close to the foothills right now, and
by letting the horses rest up a bit we can reach
them inside of half an hour or so.”</p>

<p>“But, Frank, what do we want to get to the
hills for; you don’t expect a cloudburst out here
on the open; and we could lie down here as well as
most any place?” the Kentucky boy remarked.</p>

<p>“It’s just this way,” continued Frank, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
alongside his chum, with all the horses walking;
“we think those fellows must be somewhere in
these hills. They were heading straight for them
all the time. Perhaps now they’ve even got a
shanty or a camp here. Perhaps there may be another
bunch of the same kind waiting for ’em.
Mr. Riley agrees with me that since we’ve come
this far we ought to go on and find out. Understand,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and let me say that I’m with you every
time,” returned the other. “You know how set
in my ways I am, Frank; and that once I start
out to do a thing, how unhappy I always seem
unless I get there. So count on me to keep up the
good work, if it takes a week. We must get
back that stolen treasure, one way or another.”</p>

<p>“And we will, Bob, just put that in your pipe
and smoke it,” replied the other, confidently.</p>

<p>“There’s the foothills right ahead of us now!”
said Mr. Riley, who had been riding a little in the
van, but where he could hear all that was said.</p>

<p>“And we’ll none of us be sorry when this long
ride is over,” remarked Frank.</p>

<span class="fs80">A LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“We might as well drop off here, boys!” said
Mr. Riley, after they had reached the base of
the hills.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t change your mind about that,
please,” sighed Bob, as he slid from his saddle,
and almost fell upon the ground.</p>

<p>But this was more on account of the stiffness
of his legs than because he was utterly exhausted.
He proved this shortly afterwards, when he insisted
on removing the saddle and bridle from
Domino, and fastening the lariat to his neck, so
that the animal might not stray.</p>

<p>The three lolled upon the soft, yielding turf,
which never felt finer. Bob was on his back,
staring up at the black heavens, back of which the
moon shone, even if they could not see it.</p>

<p>“This feels fine and dandy,” he commented,
stretching himself.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be beat!” declared Frank, who was
doing the same thing as was his chum, and with
as much relief to his cramped muscles.</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to go hungry to-night, boys,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
remarked Mr. Riley; “which is some hardship
to a couple of lively and growing lads, I take it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! if it comes to the worst,” chuckled Frank,
“I’ve got a little something here in my ditty bag.
Always carry a small lot of dried beef along.
Once in a while it comes in mighty handy. Try
it, Bob?”</p>

<p>“It might take my mind off other things if I
worked my jaws; so perhaps you can pass me
along a little hunk,” the other replied. “Fact is,
I’m more thirsty than near the starvation point.”</p>

<p>“Hark!”</p>

<p>Frank said this, as he sat upright.</p>

<p>“It was only one of the horses, Frank, giving
a little wheeze,” Bob remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that; and it was Buckskin too,”
Frank went on. “I reckon I know just what that
little wheeze means. The wise chap smells water
close by. There must be a creek coming down
from the hills somewhere near.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps if we listened we might hear it
gurgle,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea, old fellow,” Frank observed.</p>

<p>They listened carefully.</p>

<p>“I think I get it,” said Frank, whose ears
proved to be keener than those of his companions;
“and it’s over in this direction, too,” pointing to
the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“Suppose you go and see, then,” suggested
Mr. Riley.</p>

<p>“I will,” Frank replied, always ready to do
anything that would be for the comfort or pleasure
of his friends, no matter what his physical
condition.</p>

<p>He was gone perhaps five minutes, when he returned.
Bob was startled as he suddenly saw a
dark form loom up alongside.</p>

<p>“It’s there, just as I expected, fellows,” Frank
declared. “And so we’d better lead the horses
along that way. Fine place to sleep, too, with
the music of that little brook sounding in your
ears. Nothing could be nicer, according to my
way of thinking.”</p>

<p>Bob managed to get to his feet. He was surprised
to find how stiff he seemed to be after lying
there for that short time.</p>

<p>The horses could hardly be restrained; for they
knew what awaited them beyond. And once they
reached the little stream that came from the
heights above, it was astonishing how eagerly
they bent down and quaffed the cooling liquid.</p>

<p>They lay there for an hour or more, resting.</p>

<p>“Sleepy, Bob?” asked Frank, after there had
been absolute silence for some time.</p>

<p>“Oh! a little,” replied the other, candidly;
“but not enough to keep me out of any game
you’re engineering, Frank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“I thought that perhaps you’d dropped off,”
remarked Frank, laughingly.</p>

<p>“Well I was thinking of other scenes, that’s
the truth,” admitted Bob; “and didn’t pay any
attention to what you two were talking about. Is
there any game on foot now? Are you thinking
of doing a little looking around?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what,” answered the other; “but
we can get on without you, if you’d rather stay
here by the horses, and rest up.”</p>

<p>Truth to tell, Bob was secretly hoping that
would be the programme for them all; but being a
proud lad he would not have confessed it for
worlds.</p>

<p>“What! me stay here while the rest of you
are hunting for those rascals?” he exclaimed, as
though indignant at the bare mention of such a
thing. “Not much you don’t, my boy. I go
wherever you do. Just stick a pin through that,
will you? And now, what’s doing?”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, we just thought we’d like to follow
up this stream a bit,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“But what for?” demanded the other, groping
in darkness as to a motive.</p>

<p>“You know we believe those two robbers came
to these foothills?” Frank went on. “And we
had some sort of notion that perhaps they knew
all along where they were heading. In other
words, that they had either a camp here, or else a
shack. Get that, Bob?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Sure I do; but go on, please,” said Bob,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“You saw what we did just as soon as we hit
here, and got an idea there was water around—made
a bee line for the same as fast as we could
hike!” Frank continued.</p>

<p>“And you believe they would do the same; is
that it?” Bob demanded.</p>

<p>“If anybody put up a shack, or even a camp
here, in these hills, he’d be foolish not to make
constant use of this little creek. And as we are
about at the place where it spreads out on the
plain, it stands to reason we must look above for
any sign of our game. How about it now, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I’m on, all right. It’s as plain as the nose
on my face, once you explain the business. And
Frank, you’ll never have to tell me that thing
again. Once is enough for me. Do we start right
away?”</p>

<p>“Might as well,” replied his chum. “We
only expect to go so far; and if nothing shows up,
it’s back here for us, and a good sleep till morning.”</p>

<p>“And then?” Bob continued.</p>

<p>“Oh! we’ll cross that bridge when we come to
it,” laughed Frank, meaning of course, by this,
that he and Mr. Riley had not as yet discussed
what another day might bring forth.</p>

<p>They took note of the lay of the land, so
that when they wished to return to where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
horses had been left they could easily find the
place.</p>

<p>“Of course all we have to do is to drop down
the hill alongside the stream; but we would want
to know when we had arrived,” said Frank, as
he fastened a spare white handkerchief he happened
to have with him, to a stick, which later
he thrust into the ground. “I’ve often been
joshed because I carried that along with me when
a red bandana is the only kind for a cowboy to
have; but it’s served a use more than once, and
will again,” he added.</p>

<p>“Do you think miners have camps in among
these hills?” asked Bob, always seeking information.</p>

<p>“How about it, Mr. Riley; you ought to know
better than a fellow whose home is about two
hundred miles to the north of this, and on a
cattle ranch at that?” and Frank turned to the
ex-superintendent of the Cherry Blossom mine
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“There are no mines here that I know about,”
replied Mr. Riley. “But every little while we
hears about some prospectin’ party strikin’ copper,
or somethin’ over here. Reckon now there might
be a camp or two around inside of fifty mile; with
a bunch of happy-go-lucky fellers holdin’ out.
P’raps we’ll strike one above, an’ find our birds
minglin’ with the rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“It might be worse,” admitted Frank. “I had
an idea we would find that they belonged to some
bunch of outlaws from the other side of the
border, and come up here just on purpose to rob
the Cherry Blossom strong box every month.”</p>

<p>“It’s all guessing in the air, you see,” Mr.
Riley remarked. “So let’s get a move on, and
find out how things stand.”</p>

<p>They now left the spot where the three horses
were grazing, secured with their ropes; and began
to climb upward, following the course of the
little stream.</p>

<p>It was not so easy as they might have anticipated,
for the trees soon began to shut out what
little light came from the clouded heavens, and
made it doubly dark.</p>

<p>Bob of course brought up the rear, and Frank
was careful not to proceed at such a pace as he
fancied might distress his chum, unused to such
work.</p>

<p>They had been climbing in this way for some
little while, when those in the advance halted, as
though they wished the tail-ender to catch up.
And when Bob did come along, he was not quite
sure whether it had been decided to turn back,
or that one of his companions had found out something
worth investigating.</p>

<p>“What is it?” was his natural query as he
drew up alongside the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Bend your head down, and then look up the
hill under these lower branches of the aspen tree.
What do you see, Bob?” asked Frank, quietly.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a light, sure!” said the other, almost
immediately.</p>

<p>“You’re right it is, Bob!”</p>

<p>“But not a camp fire, Frank; it looks to me as
if it came out of a window in a cabin of some
sort,” continued the Kentucky lad, steadily, knowing
that his chum wished to learn what he thought,
so as to discover whether he were making any advance
in woodcraft.</p>

<p>“Just what it is,” declared Frank; “and we’ve
got to find out who is in that same cabin.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br>
<span class="fs80">THE LONE SHACK</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Well,” said Bob, “I’m glad for one thing;
the job will soon be over, and then we can get a
little rest.”</p>

<p>Frank chuckled at this, upon which his chum
hastily continued:</p>

<p>“Now, don’t think I’m sorry I came, because
I’m not. Nothing could have hired me to stay
below there, while you and Mr. Riley were doing
things up here. All the same, I admit that I’m
some tired, and when we’re through with the job
I’ll throw up my hat and yell.”</p>

<p>“So will I, Bob,” replied Frank, seriously;
“on condition that we meet success in our hunt.
But here’s Mr. Riley, ready to do some more
climbing; so we’d better put off talking till after
we’ve done something worth while.”</p>

<p>After that broad hint Bob remained as
“dumb as a clam,” as he himself would have expressed
it.</p>

<p>They still followed the course of the little
gurgling stream. Frank’s guess in the beginning
had turned out to be all right. The shanty, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
shack, whichever it might prove to be, had undoubtedly
been built close to the running water.
Whoever put it up originally knew the great value
of a never-failing spring in the front yard; for
this was a land of many deserts.</p>

<p>Foot by foot the three crawled upward. It was
not hard going, for the incline at this point proved
to be fairly easy; only the brush and undergrowth
in places caused them considerable difficulty.</p>

<p>“It’s gone!” whispered Bob, presently, in the
ear of his chum.</p>

<p>“Chances are it only vanished because some
rock came between us and the gleam, and we’ll
get another peep at the light in a minute,” Frank
answered.</p>

<p>“Right again, Frank, for there, I just had a
glimpse of it once more. And, seems to me, the
light is shining brighter than ever.”</p>

<p>“We’re closer, for one thing,” Frank replied.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley did not attempt to act as leader
now. Perhaps he had been observing Frank’s
actions, and come to the conclusion that the lad
knew more about these things than he did. As a
mine superintendent Mr. Riley was in his element;
but he had never professed to be an expert
woodsman, or a prairie rider. Hence, he seemed
more than satisfied to let Frank take the lead
just now.</p>

<p>They had by this time drawn so close that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
light could be plainly seen; and even Bob could
tell that it came from some small opening in the
wall of a shack, that served the purpose of ventilation,
as a window, though it probably had no
glass.</p>

<p>Frank was now using redoubled caution. Bob
wondered how his chum ever managed to slip
along as he did, very much after the manner of a
cat creeping up on a wary bird. He seemed to
make no sound at all; and Bob was painfully conscious
that his own movements must seem clumsy
in comparison.</p>

<p>But later on, when he had a chance to ask his
chum about it, Frank was loud in his praise; and
declared that, considering the little experience
which his chum from Kentucky had had, he did
remarkably well.</p>

<p>Of course Bob was growing more and more excited
the closer they approached to the shack. He
wondered what they would see there. Would the
occupants prove to be the same two men whom
they had chased all the way from the vicinity of
the Cherry Blossom mine?</p>

<p>On the other hand, they might turn out to be
a party of innocent prospectors, who knew nothing
about the robbery of the strong room.</p>

<p>Bob hardly knew which way his hopes turned.
Of course he wanted to get back the lost treasure
of gold which had been so boldly seized; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
hoped there would be no desperate fighting. As
yet he had never seen a man shot down deliberately;
and he feared that Mr. Riley was in a bad
temper; for he could hear him grinding his strong
white teeth every time his head chanced to come
close to that of the ex-superintendent.</p>

<p>Bob noticed one thing. They were no longer
heading directly for the light, but had veered off
a little. Apparently, then, Frank meant to approach
it from an angle; or else he had some other
nice little scheme in view.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob felt the hand of his chum grip
his arm. He understood from this that he was
expected to remain perfectly motionless. The
light was temporarily blotted out to some extent;
but there was no mystery about it.</p>

<p>Some one had thrust a head out of the window,
as though to take an observation. Bob found
himself wondering whether the fellow was interested
in the state of the weather; or imagined
that he had heard some suspicious sound near
by, which deserved attention.</p>

<p>For perhaps a full minute they all remained
there like statues. Then the light shone again.
The man had drawn in his head!</p>

<p>Frank moved silently away again, still veering
to one side. He gently drew Bob after him, as
though giving him to understand that it was his
wish they should all keep together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>In this manner, then, they reached the wall of
the shack, which Bob speedily discovered was
constructed of logs.</p>

<p>Even before they had arrived Bob made a discovery.
He knew why Frank had concluded that
the risk of peeping in at the window was too
great. There was a far better opportunity to
accomplish the same purpose without taking any
chances.</p>

<p>When it was originally built, perhaps, the cabin
had been made wind-proof in the customary way
by filling the chinks between the logs with mud;
which, drying in the course of time, would resemble
mortar. In numerous places this had
fallen away, leaving little gaps, through which
the light came, varied according to the size of the
opening.</p>

<p>Bob saw that these presented excellent peepholes.
By putting an eye to such a crack pretty
nearly all the interior of the cabin might be explored,
granted that the light remained within.</p>

<p>And again did Bob find occasion to admire the
smartness of his chum, while mentally deploring
his own lack of the same quality.</p>

<p>Each of the three creepers selected a crack for
his field of operations, and quickly put his eye to
it.</p>

<p>What Bob saw, his two companions also gazed
upon. It did not amount to much, for the lone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
cabin in the foothills was utterly devoid of anything
in the shape of comforts, showing that it
had long been deserted.</p>

<p>Two men were in sight. They sat upon a
couple of old chairs that had once been built by
the pioneer occupying the cabin, and left behind
when he departed for regions unknown. There
was a slab of wood that served as a table, such
as it was; and upon this stood a lantern.</p>

<p>A fire crackled upon the hearth, and some sort
of meal seemed to be cooking in a kettle; for the
steam was coming out under the lid, and there was
also an odor of beans.</p>

<p>Bob did not like the looks of the two men.
Perhaps they might be prospectors; but their
faces were certainly vicious ones. And judging
from their appearance, they had lately been
through more or less hard luck. They looked
tired and ugly.</p>

<p>Bob immediately came to the conclusion that
these must be the men he and his comrades had
chased all the way from Cherry Blossom mine.
They were talking at intervals, but while the
murmur of their voices came to his ear, he could
not make out a single word they said. The stream
happened to drop several feet in a little waterfall
close by; and this created a volume of sound
calculated to deaden any ordinary noise.</p>

<p>Bob pulled Frank’s head down close to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
mouth, so he could whisper. It was very important,
in his eyes at least, that he should start
off right. If these two men were only strangers,
in whom they had no interest, what folly for him
to keep on believing that they were the gold
thieves.</p>

<p>“Are they the ones we chased?” was what
he whispered into Frank’s ear.</p>

<p>“Yes, sure!” came the reply; “and I know
one only too well. It’s Reddy Cramer. Mr.
Riley knows him, too.”</p>

<p>Frank had taken pattern from Bob in drawing
the head of the other down, so he might say
these few words directly into his ear.</p>

<p>Bob made no reply. None seemed necessary
under the circumstances. Yes, he remembered
hearing all sorts of stories about that same Reddy
Cramer. Frank had told him how the man had
given so much trouble at the mine; and some six
months back had been run out of camp, with a
warning that he would be harshly handled should
he ever dare come back.</p>

<p>Reddy had evidently waited his time about returning.
And he had formed a plan whereby he
could have the laugh on the superintendent. Perhaps
he knew about the threatening strike. Possibly
he may even have had friends fomenting
trouble at the Cherry Blossom, so as to make his
raid the more easily carried out. If one-half that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
had been told about Reddy were true, he would
have been equal to this.</p>

<p>But, somehow, Bob thought the squatty man
with the red hair did not look as happy as he
might for one who had just carried a brilliant
stroke of business to completion. In fact, he
seemed to have a dark scowl on his face. And
as Bob noted his actions he saw him bring his
clenched fist down on the slab of wood serving as
a table, with considerable vim, as he said something
to his mate.</p>

<p>This latter was a tall, lean fellow. He had
a dark skin, and Bob fancied that possibly he
was a Mexican, though he dressed as an American.
Whether a gambler, or just an ordinary
business man gone wrong, if his face were an index
to his character, he must be a good match
for Reddy.</p>

<p>Bob now began to wonder what the next move
would be. If these were the robbers, of course
they must be captured. Could this be done without
a fight? They looked like desperate men,
and must be heavily armed. Having once gained
possession of the gold such fellows would certainly
not give up their prize tamely.</p>

<p>This brought another thrill in its train. Bob
had never been closely connected with any real
out and out “scrap,” as the boys of Circle Ranch
would call it. He thought longingly of those same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
boys right now, and wished a few of them might
be along to throw the weight of their influence in
the scale.</p>

<p>True, with Mr. Riley to assist, they were three
against two; but then there could hardly be any
comparison between a pair of half grown boys,
and these desperate men.</p>

<p>But, as has been said before, Bob was not lacking
in what the boys of the ranch called “sand.”
He shut his teeth firmly together, and made up
his mind that no matter what was required of
him, he would do his level best to fill the bill.
Frank must have no occasion to feel ashamed of
his Kentucky chum.</p>

<p>Besides, if this bold robbery were let go unpunished,
it would undoubtedly serve as a bait to
tempt others to try the same game. Consequently
the rich gold mine must soon become an unprofitable
business. And his father had a heavy interest
in the successful working of the Cherry Blossom.</p>

<p>He began to speculate as to how they ought to
manage so as to take the pair of scoundrels by
surprise. Two of them might jump in through
the open door, which was on the side of the cabin
opposite the window, and thus uphill; while the
other could lean through the window, and call
upon the men to throw up their hands.</p>

<p>Or perhaps Frank might think it worth while
to hang around a bit. The men looked dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
tired, and would have to lie down soon. While
they slept they might be taken by surprise, and
captured the more easily.</p>

<p>So Bob was weaving fancies as he knelt there,
and glued his eye to his crack between two logs.
Frank was alongside, and, just beyond, Mr. Riley
occupied himself in much the same fashion.</p>

<p>It was while the Kentucky boy was trying to
figure upon the best plan of action, just to see how
near he could come to what must be passing in
Frank’s mind, that he became aware of a certain
fact that seemed to alter conditions completely.</p>

<p>The window was over on the left, but plainly
seen from his peep-hole. He chanced to glance
that way, possibly his eye being attracted by some
slight movement, Bob never knew. And to his
utter astonishment he discovered a human face
thrust cautiously up above the sill, while a pair of
keen eyes ranged around the interior of the lone
shack on the hillside!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<span class="fs80">“WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Hush!”</p>

<p>Frank’s hand gripped Bob’s arm even as this
warning hiss sounded in his ear. And Bob knew
that his chum must have caught sight of that face
at the same time he did. Undoubtedly Frank
had felt a sudden fear lest the other call out, or
in some other way betray their presence. And he
wished to give warning, so that Bob might control
his feelings.</p>

<p>Who was the man? His face was a strange one
to Bob. Could he be the third fellow who may
have been deserted by Reddy and his companion?
And if so, had he followed them all the way here,
bent upon some revenge, to get even for their
treachery?</p>

<p>He was gone again now; but Bob did not
imagine he had left the neighborhood of the shack.
If, as he believed, the fellow proved to be the
third robber, he would want his share of the
spoils; and in order to get it would hang around
until the chance arose.</p>

<p>It was too bad, in one way, because his presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
was apt to interfere with any plan they might arrange.
But then Frank was smart enough, perhaps,
to profit by what seemed like a disaster.</p>

<p>Again Bob turned his attention to the two men
inside. They seemed to have no suspicion that
they were being watched. Perhaps they believed
their comrade must ere this have fallen into the
hands of the miners; or met his fate in some deep
hole in the mountains, to which they had consigned
him, when he was taken off his guard.</p>

<p>They were arguing again. Each seemed trying
to convince the other of something, and the pounding
of the slab table kept up. Bob wondered
whether they might not come to the point of an
open rupture. That would profit those who sought
to effect their capture.</p>

<p>The time crept on. Bob was beginning to grow
tired of crouching there, peeping through that narrow
slit between the logs. He wished something
would happen to bring about a change.</p>

<p>The two men had apparently arrived at some
conclusion, for they pushed back from the table.</p>

<p>“All right, then, it’s a go, Reddy!” Bob heard
the tall man exclaim. “If we’re going to separate
we’ll divvy things up, share and share alike!”</p>

<p>“I tell ye, Blaisdell, it’s goin’ to be too hot
around here to suit me after this job,” the other
was saying; “and I’m set on hikin’ out of the
section. Further North they don’t know Reddy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
Cramer, an’ I kin get a chance to work in. ’Sides,
I’m hopin’ some to set eyes on a certain gent that
I owes a heap to; and if I do, he’ll never crow
again over what he did to me.”</p>

<p>Bob was unable to make anything out of this.
If Frank succeeded better he found no means of
communicating the fact to his chum. Indeed, Bob
did not dream that he could have a particle of interest
in this unknown party against whom Reddy
seemed to be holding a grudge.</p>

<p>The man called Blaisdell stepped over to the
middle of the room. Stooping, he seemed to dig
his fingers under a certain rough plank of the
floor. As a usual thing such border cabins have
only the hard earth to serve as a floor; but the
man who built this shack had gone to the trouble
of cutting timber, splitting it, and even making
rough planks with which to cover the earth.</p>

<p>When Blaisdell had pulled one of these up he
bent over. Bob felt himself shivering with eagerness
and anticipation. Of course there could be
but one explanation of the actions of the two robbers.
Having agreed to part company they were
now about to divide the spoils.</p>

<p>Since he had figured it all out in this way, Bob
was therefore not much surprised to see Blaisdell
toss out what looked to be a small bag. After
that he bent down again and secured a second.
Mr. Riley had said there were three; but the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
made no further movement looking to unearthing
another sack.</p>

<p>Well, if they managed to recover two-thirds of
the treasure, that was worth while, Bob thought,
as he fixed his eyes on the bundles. It struck him
that Blaisdell must be a much stronger man than
his thin appearance would seem to indicate. Mr.
Riley had said that each of the three sacks must
have weighed in the neighborhood of sixty
pounds; and here was a man who thought little
of tossing such a package aside, as though it were
next to nothing.</p>

<p>Bob expected to see each of the men pick up
one of the bags, and start for the door. He even
found himself wondering what Frank’s next move
might be. Would he try to stop them from departing?
Undoubtedly they must have horses
somewhere close by, for they had come there
mounted.</p>

<p>They sat down again, as if to talk matters over
once more, with the two sacks of treasure close
to their feet.</p>

<p>If only now Reddy and Blaisdell would go out
of the shack for a short time, to saddle their
horses, it might be that a fine chance would come
up for the recovery of the treasure! Bob believed
he could slip inside the cabin himself, and
carry off one of the sacks.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob saw something moving near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
open door. At first he could not make out what it
was that kept advancing so strangely.</p>

<p>Presently he managed to figure out what seemed
to be a human head—no, there were two of them,
belonging to men who had covered their bodies
with an old blanket, and were thus creeping, inch
by inch, toward the inmates of the shack.</p>

<p>Reddy and Blaisdell did not see what was coming,
because they happened to have their backs toward
the door. And Bob found himself strangely
thrilled by the prospect of an encounter in which
he and his companions would have no part.</p>

<p>Perhaps the newcomers might turn out to be
some of Reddy’s former companions, who, knowing
of his recent raid on the strong room of the
Cherry Blossom mine, had determined to pay his
shack in the foothills a secret visit, in hope of
snatching his rich spoils away.</p>

<p>Of course Frank and Mr. Riley were watching
just as eagerly as was Bob; and perhaps they, too,
began to entertain hopes of being able to profit
from what was about to happen in the cabin.</p>

<p>The gray blanket kept moving along the floor
toward the spot where Reddy and his companion
sat and talked earnestly, with the two sacks at
their feet.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob gave a little gasp.</p>

<p>“It’s coming!” he exclaimed, as he saw Blaisdell
turn his head and look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Immediately things began to happen. First of
all the gray blanket was seen to rear up, as the
pair of hiding men scrambled to their feet. At
the same time Reddy and Blaisdell jumped up,
with hoarse shouts.</p>

<p>Bob heard a shot, several of them in fact. He
knew that the four men were struggling desperately
at close quarters, and that undoubtedly the advantage
lay with the newcomers, who had surprised
the others.</p>

<p>For a short time he crouched there, staring
through the crack, fascinated by the scene, yet appalled
at the same time.</p>

<p>One of the struggling men had gone down
heavily. Bob believed that it must be Blaisdell,
for he could still see Reddy struggling with one of
the intruders.</p>

<p>They reeled about the room, each striving to
get the advantage.</p>

<p>Bob at this moment became aware of the fact
that some one was pulling at his arm. Of course
it was Frank, who wanted to make a change in
their position, and was desirous of having his
chum accompany him.</p>

<p>Bob arose, and keeping hold of the other,
started off. Frank was heading to pass around
the corner of the shack; and it was not difficult to
understand that the open door was the object of
his attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Riley, too, was with them, only too anxious
to have a hand in what was taking place
inside the cabin. While he had kept on grinding
his strong teeth together, no doubt at the same
time he was holding his passions in check with
the greatest difficulty. And here was where he expected
to get even for the little joke Reddy and
his comrades had played upon him as the superintendent
of the Cherry Blossom mine.</p>

<p>Of course it took but a very little time to round
the corner of the hut; and as they did so Bob saw
the figure of a man rush out of the cabin, carrying
some bulky object over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“He’s gone, Frank, and carried one of the bags
off with him!” cried the Kentucky boy, astonished
and overwhelmed by what he had seen.</p>

<p>They were now at the door, and could look in.
Blaisdell lay motionless in a corner; while the
man who had been wrestling with Reddy appeared
to have managed to get the better of him.
He was kneeling over the other, and seemed to be
either threatening him with some weapon, or else
trying to tie his wrists.</p>

<p>“Look out for him, Mr. Riley!” cried Frank.
“You, Bob, come along with me!”</p>

<p>A little while before Bob had been complaining
about feeling weary. All that had passed away
now; and really he forgot that there was such a
thing as fatigue. The excitement of the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
had him in its grip, and he believed he could run
as well as ever in his life.</p>

<p>Frank had darted off even while speaking, and
there was no need to tell Bob what object he had
in view. That second sack of treasure must be recovered.
To let this bold thief steal it from
Reddy was not to be thought of.</p>

<p>Bob could hear the fellow plunging down the
side of the hill. Doubtless he was satisfied with
having secured his share of the plunder, and willing
to let his companion shift for himself.</p>

<p>They could hear him plainly; for in his haste
the man crashed through any and all obstructions
that came in his way. Several times from the
sounds it would appear as though he must have
fallen. On each occasion, however, he evidently
recovered himself, and continued the flight.</p>

<p>“What’s he going to do, Frank?” he managed
to ask, as he kept alongside the other.</p>

<p>“Horses below somewhere!” came the short
reply, showing that Frank himself had been figuring
on the meaning of the man’s actions.</p>

<p>“We’re gaining some, aren’t we?” Bob went
on, eagerly; for he was now deeply interested in
the result of the chase.</p>

<p>“Yes, that bag holds him back some,” answered
the other.</p>

<p>Bob could well understand that. If it weighed
about sixty pounds it was no little handicap for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
the fellow who was heading down the slope of
the hill. And little wonder that he pitched headlong
several times.</p>

<p>It looked as though the treasure taken from
the Cherry Blossom strong room was fated to be
recovered piecemeal. Here was one sack; another
still lay on the floor of the shack above,
while the hiding place of the third still remained
a mystery to be solved later on.</p>

<p>All at once the plunging ceased, and there was
silence. So profound was this that Bob could hear
the fret and murmur of the falling water not far
away.</p>

<p>“That last tumble must have settled him,
Frank!” he gasped; for the sudden silence had
indeed been preceded by a crash of unusual
violence.</p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s so,” Frank admitted; “or else
he’s trying a change of tactics!”</p>

<p>“In what way?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Knowing that we could follow him as long as
he kept up all that row, he may be crawling away
now. Come on, Bob; we’ve just got to get him—and
that bag!”</p>

<p>The halt had been but momentary. They were
once more in full pursuit, heading for the spot
where that last crash among the bushes had been
heard.</p>

<p>Bob believed that never before in all his life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
had he taken part in such an exciting time as
came with the pursuit of the men who had carried
off the treasure.</p>

<p>And for all he knew the end was not yet, since
none of the gold had been recovered, despite their
strenuous efforts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br>
<span class="fs80">THE SURRENDER</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Do you hear him now, Frank?” whispered
the Kentucky boy, as they once more halted for a
few seconds, and listening eagerly.</p>

<p>“I thought I caught some sort of little rustling
sound,” came the answer.</p>

<p>“Which way?” continued Bob.</p>

<p>“There! that was it again!” exclaimed Frank.
“Come along, and be careful not to stumble if
you can help it.”</p>

<p>That was easy to say, but, to tell the truth, Bob
never had a more difficult task set before him.
The darkness of the night prevented him from
making sure of his footing; and there were so
very many of those troublesome vines trailing
across the way, that at any second he was apt to
catch his foot in one.</p>

<p>Still, he was doing his best to carry out the
wishes of his chum. It seemed most important
that they should overtake the fellow who had
snatched up one of those treasure bags, and was
straining every nerve in the endeavor to escape
with the spoils which Reddy and Blaisdell had
just been about to divide, ere separating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>Of course Bob had sized up the situation ere
now. He knew that these two newcomers must
be former associates of the three gold thieves.
Possibly they had been betrayed, and, feeling
that they had been harshly treated, the result was
a scheme to call on Reddy at his lone shack, after
the affair had been concluded, and secure the
treasure for themselves.</p>

<p>The two boys were again advancing. Frank
believed he knew just where the suspicious sounds
came from; and having mentally located the spot,
he now hoped to catch the fellow.</p>

<p>A jack-rabbit bounded out from the bushes, and
jumped away. The sound gave Bob a start, for
he thought it must mean a sudden rush on the
part of the man they were after.</p>

<p>“Only a long-ear!” whispered Frank; for as
his arm was in touch with that of his chum, he felt
the quiver that passed over Bob.</p>

<p>Even this circumstance had not diverted the attention
of Frank from the spot where he fully believed
the fugitive was crouching.</p>

<p>Knowing the desperate nature of men who
could engage in such a risky business, Bob fully
anticipated that he and Frank would be fired upon
at any moment. To be sure, this fellow could not
know who they were, but must suppose his pursuers
were Reddy and Blaisdell. These two would
not be apt to show any mercy, should they overtake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
their former friend; and, consequently, the
man in hiding would feel that his situation was
desperate.</p>

<p>Just as Bob had expected, Frank had a plan
that fitted the occasion.</p>

<p>“Stop!” was whispered in his ear, as he felt
his comrade bending down.</p>

<p>Frank seemed to be feeling for something or
other, perhaps a stone; whatever it was, he had
evidently succeeded in finding it, for he immediately
straightened up, and Bob knew that his
arm was swinging for a cast.</p>

<p>Then came a crash as the stone landed in a
thicket some thirty feet below. Instantly there
was a bright flash, and the report of a pistol. The
crouching fugitive had discharged his weapon,
aiming at the spot where he believed one of his
pursuers was located.</p>

<p>A second and a third shot followed as fast as
he could pull the trigger. Bob heard his chum
chuckle as though greatly pleased. This was
some more of that woodcraft which played so
great a part in the education of a boy born and
raised in the West.</p>

<p>They knew now exactly where the fellow was
located. That was one good thing. Perhaps
another was the fact that he had exhausted half
the contents of his revolver.</p>

<p>Bob knew that Frank was stooping again. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
must be so well satisfied with the result of his first
test, that he wanted to make another try.</p>

<p>When he felt his chum rise up again, the Kentucky
boy knew what to expect. And this time,
if anything, the crash in the bushes was louder
than before. The stone had been adroitly cast, so
that it should fall a little further on.</p>

<p>Apparently Frank had carried out his little
scheme so well that it completely deceived the man
in hiding. He must have thought that while his
enemy may have escaped serious injury in that
first volley, he was now in full retreat.</p>

<p>So the hidden one began again to pull the trigger,
and three shots rang out in rapid succession.</p>

<p>Then a silence fell upon the side of the foothills!</p>

<p>Bob heard Frank laugh softly to himself as
though quite pleased over the success of his
scheme.</p>

<p>“His gun’s empty,” whispered Frank; “I’ve
pulled the snake’s fangs. Now for a rush in on
him. Ready, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, say when,” answered the other, nerving
himself for the concluding act in the stirring little
drama.</p>

<p>“Now! Come on!”</p>

<p>At these words Frank sprang forward, with
Bob at his side, ready to do his best to assist in
the work of rounding up the treasure thief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>They no longer cared to conceal the fact of
their coming. Indeed, it seemed to Bob that his
chum made more noise than was really necessary
as he plunged down the side of the hill toward
the spot from whence those flashes had sprung.</p>

<p>“He wants to make the fellow think a whole
army is closing in on him, and scare him into surrendering!”
was the thought that flashed through
Bob’s mind, even as he was leaping forward.</p>

<p>That was just what Frank meant. He knew
that the fellow could still give them more or less
trouble if he tried to continue his mad flight down
the descent. But as he already believed that he
had foes beyond, since the stones had crashed in
the bushes there, with these new enemies coming
down on him from the rear he must feel that he
was hemmed in.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” shouted Frank, as gruffly as possible.</p>

<p>“We’ve got you surrounded! No use trying to
run away! Better give up!” called Bob, falling
in with the idea which he realized his comrade
had in view.</p>

<p>They must by now be very near the spot where
the unknown crouched. The question which
arose was whether he would be seriously impressed
with a sense of his position, and surrender
or try to escape.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doing, Reddy; I quit!” a hoarse voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
suddenly shouted, almost under their feet; and at
same instant Bob caught sight of a moving figure,
dimly seen in the dense shadows.</p>

<p>“Throw up your hands, quick!” snapped
Frank, just as he imagined Old Hank Coombs
might call out under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>“They are up, as high as I kin get ’em, Reddy,
so don’t bother shootin’!” cried the unknown.</p>

<p>“Drop down on your face then, and lie there!”
Bob heard his chum order; and he was more than
ever filled with admiration for the clever manner
in which Frank seemed able to manage things.</p>

<p>The dark, shadowy figure immediately got
down on the ground, as though only too eager to
oblige. Frank threw himself upon the fellow’s
back without wasting any time.</p>

<p>“Get one of his arms here, and help me put
this handkerchief around his wrists, Reddy!” he
said, still trying to make his voice sound as gruff
as possible, in order to keep up the deception.</p>

<p>Bob understood why he did this. If the man
imagined for a single second that he had given in
to a couple of boys, he might start fresh hostilities,
overcome by a sense of rage and humiliation.</p>

<p>So Bob groped for the fellow’s left arm, finding
which he drew it back until Frank could cross
the two wrists. Then the big and stout bandana
handkerchief was wrapped several times around,
to be eventually secured by triple knots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“That ought to hold him fast, Frank!” remarked
Bob, who was feeling a sense of satisfaction
over the final success that had followed
their hot chase down the side of the foothills.</p>

<p>“It will, too,” replied the other, as he took his
knee off the back of the unfortunate man. “Now,
get up!”</p>

<p>It was not so easy a thing to do, considering
the fact that his arms were held fast behind him.
The man started to obey, but Bob had to help
him. Presently, however, he was on his feet,
muttering to himself.</p>

<p>“Bob, you hold on to him, and if he makes
the first move to run, trip him up, even if he
breaks his nose in falling,” remarked Frank.</p>

<p>“That goes!” answered the other, sturdily, as
he secured a grip on the prisoner’s arm that told
he meant business.</p>

<p>Frank seemed to be fumbling in his pocket.</p>

<p>“What you going to do, Frank?” demanded
his chum.</p>

<p>“I’m after a match,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“Oh! you want to take a look at our prisoner;
is that it?”</p>

<p>“Shucks! no, not just now. I’m going to find
out where he left that bag,” came the reply, as a
crackling sound told he had secured the match he
wanted.</p>

<p>When the light flared up the eyes of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
prisoner were turned on first one of the saddle
boys and then the other. Plainly he was amazed
at what he saw. Instead of Reddy and Blaisdell
he discovered that his captors were only a pair of
lads.</p>

<p>Bob had been curious enough to let his eyes
seek the face of the prisoner for a second or
two. Not that he was anxious to see how the
man looked; but what he thought of the situation.</p>

<p>“Don’t you try to get away, or something will
happen that you won’t like, mister,” Bob said,
threateningly; for from the disgusted expression
on the face of the man he feared that he might
make a bolt.</p>

<p>Frank searched as long as the match burned;
but, as Bob did not hear him utter any exclamation
of satisfaction, he concluded that success had
not as yet come to him. The fugitive must have
tried to hide the sack of treasure, thinking that
if he got away he could come creeping back later
on and recover possession of the spoils.</p>

<p>But Frank had other matches. And he was
not the boy to let one little failure discourage
him. Having covered about all the ground in the
immediate vicinity he conceived the idea of retracing
their steps, and keeping a bright lookout
as they went along.</p>

<p>“Stir him up, and make him go ahead, Bob;”
he remarked. “If he tries any funny business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
you know just what to do; and don’t be afraid
to give it to him straight.”</p>

<p>Such talk as this was apt to make the prisoner
think twice before attempting to escape. He must
evidently believe that while his captors might only
be boys, they had been in touch with men of the
ranch and the mine so long that they knew all
the ropes, and were not to be treated lightly.</p>

<p>“Get along!” said Bob.</p>

<p>Grumblingly the fellow obeyed. He seemed
to have no choice in the matter, since, with his
arms bound, he was practically helpless.</p>

<p>They started up the hill. It was slow work
climbing, not nearly so easy as their descent had
been. But Frank had an object in what he was
doing. From time to time he would strike a
match, and take a keen observation. Not a tree
trunk escaped him, for he imagined that when
the fellow got rid of his bag he would naturally
enough fling it behind some such object.</p>

<p>Bob, walking alongside the prisoner, and giving
him an occasional punch with his elbow just to
remind him that he was on the alert, heard his
chum give utterance to a little laugh.</p>

<p>“Found it, Frank?” he cried, all excitement.</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” replied the other, as he stepped
to one side; “here it is, sticking out from behind
this crooked aspen, just as he flung it. Everything’s
all right, Bob, old fellow.”</p>

<span class="fs80">AN ASTONISHING DISCOVERY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Hurrah!”</p>

<p>Bob could not keep from giving voice to his
delight in this way. He saw Frank tugging at
some object, and then throw it on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Keep right along up, Bob; and don’t let him
pull the wool over your eyes. We may want to
take him to Phoenix yet, and hand him over to
the marshal,” was what Frank was saying.</p>

<p>Bob could hear the man give a dismal grunt.
He had not suspected the presence of others when
he started to work this trick on his former comrades,
with the idea of making off with the gold
they had secured.</p>

<p>In this way, then, they retraced their way upward.
Bob would never have dreamed that they
had covered such a distance in the short space of
time they had been pursuing the escaping thief.
But then, it had been all down-hill, and the desire
to get away had caused the man to cover
ground at a lively rate.</p>

<p>Frank had found the little stream again. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
was making use of it to keep in a direct line for
the lone shack, located somewhere beyond.</p>

<p>Once the man made an effort to break away,
as though his fears overcame his discretion. But
Bob was “on the job,” as he said himself. He
did not lose his grip of the fellow, despite the
abruptness of the wrench. And, remembering his
instructions from Frank, he threw out his foot,
and tripped the man, who fell heavily.</p>

<p>Frank came springing back in an instant.</p>

<p>“What’s going on here, Bob?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“He tried it, just as you said he might!” replied
the other, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“And you tripped him, was that it?”</p>

<p>“Listen to him grunt, will you?” said Bob,
feeling a little compassion for the man, who had
come down quite hard.</p>

<p>Frank still had matches left, and striking one of
these he bent over to find out how seriously the
prisoner was hurt.</p>

<p>“You’re lucky only to have a few bruises, and
a nose bleed,” he declared, presently, after he
had investigated. “Perhaps you’ll understand
now that even if we are boys, my chum and I mean
to hold on to you. Now, get up, and don’t you
try that sort of game again, if you know what’s
good for you.”</p>

<p>He helped the fellow get on his feet. There
was an air of dejection about the man now, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
though he had really come to the conclusion that
the net had closed in around him, and he would
have to “throw up his hands.”</p>

<p>“I’m done!” he muttered. “I was foolish to
try it on. An’ ketched by a pair o’ kids, too!”</p>

<p>That last exclamation seemed to size up the
whole bitterness of the situation. Had it been
grown men who had effected his capture, evidently
the fellow would not have felt so keenly about
his misfortune; but he evidently wondered how
he could ever hold up his head among his fellows
again, after allowing a couple of boys to down
him.</p>

<p>Several minutes later Frank called out:</p>

<p>“I see the light again, Bob. Keep going, and
we’ll be there soon!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” declared the Kentucky boy,
with a sigh; for he was pretty nearly exhausted
with fatigue and excitement.</p>

<p>Pretty soon even Bob caught sight of the gleam
of light that came from the window of the lone
shack, where Reddy and his partner in the robbery
of the mine had their headquarters.</p>

<p>Then Bob’s mind flew back to the last glimpse
he had had of that interior, at the time the fellow
dashed out of the door, with the bag on his back,
and they took up the chase.</p>

<p>He remembered distinctly now that Blaisdell
had seemed to be lying senseless on the floor over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
in a corner, where he had been knocked during
the fight. The other robber, he who had engineered
the whole affair from start to finish, had
been almost equally helpless under the knee of
the second intruder, the companion of the man
they chased down the hillside.</p>

<p>And Bob also recollected that, as Frank led the
way in hot pursuit, he had called out to Mr. Riley
to take charge at the shack. That would possibly
mean he was to enter the little cabin, and attack
the fellow who was pressing Reddy down.</p>

<p>How would they find matters on their arrival?
Had the ex-superintendent of the Cherry Blossom
mine been able to obtain the mastery of the situation?
Bob had in times past heard certain stories
about Mr. Riley that stamped him as a brave man.
The fact that he had barricaded himself in the engine-house,
and was defying the striking miners,
went to prove this fact.</p>

<p>Yet as they drew near the shack Bob confessed
to himself that some of his former nervousness
had returned. He wondered whether he and
Frank would become embroiled in another affair
with some of these lawless men. Bob hoped not.
Though ready to do his duty, and willing to stand
back of his chum in his effort to recover the treasure
that had been taken from the mine, Bob did
not find any delight in scenes of turmoil and fighting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>Frank, carrying the bag on his shoulder, approached
the shack with confidence. Evidently
he trusted Mr. Riley fully, and did not allow the
slightest suspicion that the other could have made
a failure of his part in the game to enter his
mind.</p>

<p>The first thing that Bob noticed was the
ominous stillness that seemed to hang over the
place. He did not know whether this might be
favorable or not.</p>

<p>“Frank, do you think they all got away; and
what could have happened to Mr. Riley?” he
could not help asking.</p>

<p>“Don’t you bother about Mr. Riley,” laughed
his chum; “when the count is made up, you’ll
sure find him on deck, and carrying things with
a high hand. Bring your man right along in, Bob.
Here we are!”</p>

<p>They had turned the corner of the shack, and
the open door stood before them. While passing
the window Bob had been sorely tempted to turn
his eyes aside, in order to take a look; but a stern
sense of his duty made him pause. For he had
a faint suspicion that should he slacken in watchfulness
over his prisoner, the man was desperate
enough to make another attempt at flight, even
though his arms were bound.</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Riley did it, as sure as anything!”
was the exclamation that broke from Bob’s lips,
involuntarily, as he stepped into the shack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>He saw the former mine superintendent standing
over two men, who were on the floor. Looking
a little farther Bob discovered that Blaisdell
was sitting in the corner, nursing his head, as
though it pained. None of the three rascals
seemed to be in possession of a weapon of any
kind, which would probably account for the little
arsenal that lay on the floor close to Mr. Riley.
He had seen to it that they were completely disarmed.</p>

<p>Noting all these things Bob gave a big sigh of
relief. It began to look as though the end might
be near. They had had a hard time of it. They
had secured two of the three original thieves; and
it appeared as if at least two-thirds of the spoils
had been recovered!</p>

<p>No wonder, then, Bob was ready to throw up
his hat, and yell. Something seemed to hold him
back, however. Perhaps it was because his chum
did not manifest any particular signs of being
overjoyed.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley looked up as they came in, and his
thin face was wreathed in a grim smile at seeing
how Frank carried the missing bag; while Bob
ushered the runaway thief into the shack.</p>

<p>“Got ’em both, eh, boys?” he greeted them
with. “Now that’s what I call going some. And
I reckon as how the Colonel will be proud of your
carryin’s-on. Looks some snug in here, doesn’t
it, Frank?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>There was something so comical in this last
remark that Frank had to laugh. No doubt it
did look “snug” from the standpoint of
Mr. Riley; but the four men who had been
“rounded up” so completely certainly gave no
evidence of appreciating the situation. Scowls
and black looks marked the faces of all of them.</p>

<p>Frank had dropped his sack alongside the other.
Turning quickly he noticed the look Reddy cast,
first at the pair of bags, and then at those who
were now in complete possession.</p>

<p>“Sit down there with your friends!” Bob told
the man who had run off with a part of the
treasure.</p>

<p>Thus the quartette were ranged along the floor.
Mr. Riley asked Frank to make use of some stout
cord which he chanced to have in his pocket; and
as none of the prisoners dared resist, the result
was that inside of a few minutes all of them were
rendered as helpless as the man Bob had brought
back to the cabin.</p>

<p>“I want to shake hands with each of you boys,”
he said, gravely, as he approached Frank; “and
say that you’re sure a credit to Circle Ranch. If
so be they run that way there, I’ll willingly accept
the offer the Colonel makes me, an’ change bunks.
And I reckon this boy from Kentucky is no more
in the tenderfoot class after this!”</p>

<p>Reddy was still observing them with a queer expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
on his face. It seemed as though the
fellow might be trying hard to repress a grin.
And considering how desperate his situation
seemed, the fact that he could see any humor in
things was indeed singular.</p>

<p>Perhaps, though, he was thinking how their victory
must be incomplete because of the fact that
one of the bags of treasure was still missing.
That was what passed through Bob’s mind, at any
rate, as he let his eye rest on the two sacks.</p>

<p>“Open one of these, while I take the other,
Bob,” Frank said, as he dropped down on the
floor beside the spoils.</p>

<p>Reddy’s grin grew still broader. He even tried
to nudge Blaisdell with his elbow, although the
effort proved a failure, owing to the fact that his
arms were too securely bound to admit of any
play.</p>

<p>Bob was only too willing to comply with the directions
of his chum. He imagined that Frank
wanted to learn whether the whole amount of
stolen gold could have been crowded into two
bags, instead of three; which was a possible way
of dividing it, after their number had been reduced.</p>

<p>The first thing Bob thought, after he had
dropped to the floor, and laid hands on the nearest
bag, was the deception that existed about these
things. For sixty pounds, perhaps nearer ninety,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
that little bag certainly felt light indeed. But
then, possibly that might be only imagination.</p>

<p>He found that a stout cord had been passed
several times around the mouth of the sack, and
as a knot promised to baffle his efforts to undo it,
the string was cut.</p>

<p>Bob opened the bag, fully expecting to discover
the yellow glitter of gold. He stared, and then
bent his head lower, as though hardly able to believe
his eyes. Frank’s low laugh surprised him,
and made him look up, to find his chum regarding
him with an expression on his face that was a
mixture of chagrin and humor.</p>

<p>“What did you draw, Bob?” he asked. “I
seem to have a lot of packages that look as if they
might hold flour, sugar, coffee, and such things;
besides some tin cups, and a platter or two; a
healthy lot of supplies for a prospector to start
with.”</p>

<p>“Whew! same here,” gasped Bob, who had
really never been more surprised in his life at
making such a disappointing discovery. “Whatever
can it mean, Frank; and what do you suppose
they’ve done with the treasure they stole from the
Cherry Blossom mine?”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKET</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was Reddy who laughed now. How could
he help it, when viewing the astonished face of
Bob Archer, who was sitting there on the floor,
and dumping out the miscellaneous assortment of
eatables that had been contained in the sacks?</p>

<p>Frank knew that the solution to the mystery
would lie with the man who had engineered the
theft. He had wondered at the disconsolate appearance
of both Reddy and Blaisdell while they
were discussing matters; finally agreeing to each
take a bag, and get out on separate trails.</p>

<p>Where was the treasure then, if they did not
have it? Could it be that, fearing capture, they
had hidden the gold? Even Bob could see that
there was but a slight chance of this proving to be
the truth.</p>

<p>Just then Bob happened to remember that, according
to all accounts, there had been a third
member of the bold outfit. All along he and
Frank had rested under the delusion that Reddy
and Blaisdell must have left this man behind,
after taking his share of the plunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“Say, perhaps the shoe was on the other foot,
and he got theirs!” exclaimed Bob, almost involuntarily.</p>

<p>At that Reddy chuckled again.</p>

<p>“I call that a good guess, now,” he remarked,
nodding to Frank, and winking his eye in the direction
of the Kentucky lad.</p>

<p>Frank understood.</p>

<p>“Meaning that the third man beat you out of
your shares; is that it, Reddy?” he asked, as he
stepped closer to the other.</p>

<p>“That’s just what he did!” growled the man
known as Blaisdell, and who appeared to be even
more dissatisfied with the way matters had turned
out than the leader himself.</p>

<p>“There were three sacks in the beginning?”
Frank went on, holding up that number of fingers,
as if to emphasize his point.</p>

<p>“Three—that’s right. Mr. Riley knows it’s
so, don’t you Mr. Riley?” the man with the fiery
hair admitted.</p>

<p>“Just one apiece, eh? And somehow in the
shuffle this third fellow managed to hoodwink you
two, so that he got away with the whole business.
Clever work to pull the wool over the eyes of such
a smart fellow as you’re said to be, Reddy Cramer!”
Frank went on, thinking he would hear the
particulars sooner if only he could excite the temper
of the other.</p>

<p>“Aw! he just ketched us nappin’, that’s how it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
happened,” grumbled Blaisdell, who seemed to
feel so keenly the utter collapse of their scheme
that he was in a frame of mind to tell everything
he knew.</p>

<p>And Reddy, seeing this evidence of turning
state’s evidence on the part of his comrade, was
himself willing to confess.</p>

<p>“We thought he was true blue, but he fooled
us, that’s how,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“But it’s hard to believe that one man could
carry away the whole three bags of gold dust
and nuggets,” remonstrated Frank. “Mr. Riley,
here, says they’d weigh something like two hundred
pounds. How about that, Reddy?”</p>

<p>“That’s all in the trick,” replied the other.
“You see, it was this way. When we got off,
each of us had a bag along. But we expected to
have a warm time gettin’ away with the loot.
And we had made up a plan to deceive Riley and
his crowd.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” broke in Blaisdell, bitterly, “an’ don’t
forget to say right there as how ’twas our smart
pal that suggested that delightful scheme, which
you an’ me tumbled right into, never dreamin’
that he had all the pipes laid to dock us, an’ leave
us to hold the bag, which didn’t have the gold in,
but the grub. Aw! this knocks me out, sure!
Never kin look anybody in the face again after
bein’ took in so easy; so dead easy!”</p>

<p>“We cached the three bags, all right,” Reddy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
went on, “meaning to come back for ’em after
we’d put any pursuers on the wrong scent. Then
we started off to leave a broad trail behind, beginnin’
from the strong room of the Cherry Blossom.
Reckon as how ye must a seen that trail,
son?”</p>

<p>“We did for a fact, and started out on it, just
as you expected,” declared Frank; “when, by
chance, we found a much newer trail crossing the
old, and made by two men instead of three. You,
never meant us to find that trail, because by following
it we got you sighted.”</p>

<p>“No more we did,” admitted Reddy. “But,
the fact is, around that time Blaisdell and me was
so mad at being taken in like a pair of tenderfeet
by that traitor, that we just didn’t care much what
came along. We done our best to fix you with
that broken cliff trail. Then, when ye still follered,
we started the blaze on the level; and reckoned
as how that had put you out of the running.”</p>

<p>“But it didn’t, as you understand now,” Frank
went on, believing that he was getting nearer the
explanation of the matter.</p>

<p>“Yes, some fellers have the nine lives of a cat;
and looks like you boys might belong in that class,”
sneered Blaisdell.</p>

<p>“Let’s go back a bit,” Frank observed. “Because
we’re some interested in this business, and
want to get that stuff away from your friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“Friend!” scoffed Reddy. “If ever I’m free
again, and I run across his tracks, he’ll sure wish
he’d never been born. Nawthin’ ain’t too tough
for a fellow as’d betray his pals like he done; and
after the idea of the raise was all mine, too.”</p>

<p>“But tell ’em all they wanter know, Reddy,”
broke in Blaisdell, eagerly. “It’s goin’ to do me
a heap of good if they kin lay hands on that slick
jay, and snatch the stuff away from him.”</p>

<p>“Well, ye see, we cached the stuff in the middle
of a little opening,” the disappointed one went on.
“I ’member now how particular he was to have
it jest so; but at the time me an’ Blaisdell here
never thought he’d give us the double cross like,
and sneak back to get away with it all, which he
did; the worse luck!”</p>

<p>“But you had horses, it seems,” remarked
Frank; “how does it come that you didn’t start
in pursuit at once, and overtake your false friend.
With two hundred pounds added to the man’s
weight, no horse could hold out long. Do you
mean to say you couldn’t follow his trail?”</p>

<p>Reddy and his mate exchanged looks, and
nodded ruefully.</p>

<p>“He didn’t leave no trail, son,” declared the
former, with a shrug of his shoulders that stood
for more than his words, perhaps.</p>

<p>“He must have, unless he flew away!” declared
Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“Which I take it is jest what our slick Jared
Scott done, son!” remarked Reddy.</p>

<p>Bob uttered a cry. Up to that instant he had
never dreamed to what the talk was leading.</p>

<p>But Frank made no outcry. In fact, he showed
positive signs of having been entertaining a certain
amount of suspicion regarding the truth. A number
of little things in the immediate past, especially
when they had caught some of the words passing
between the two men just before the attack, may
have given him a clue.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he looked wonderfully pleased,
as though this announcement concerning the identity
of the third thief went far to brush aside
some of the mystery.</p>

<p>“Jared Scott!” he repeated, after Reddy.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the sneak who fooled us,” replied
the other, with bitterness in his voice.</p>

<p>“He had a balloon—did you know that?” demanded
Frank.</p>

<p>“Naw he didn’t—then. Found it, arter he
give us the slip, and hurried back to where we
cached the stuff. He told us he had a hoss hid
somewhere near by, an’ had rid in from Phoenix.
That wasn’t so. I knowed that Jared Scott had
been helpin’ one of these here fliers as gives exhibitions
at fairs. Reckon as how he just run away
with the old gas-bag, an’ had her hid in the hills
awaitin’ his chance to get away with our treasure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“How did you find out that he had a balloon?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Why,” explained Reddy, with a sickly grin;
“after he piled the three sacks of gold aboard
he had to drop off all his bags of ballast, and we
seen ’em there in the open place. There was
other evidences too, that made us mad. But
what could we do? No use tryin’ to chase a balloon,
son. And by that time we reckoned that
Mr. Riley’d be on the hunt. So we picks up our
hosses, and runs. The rest ye knows.”</p>

<p>It was all very plain to Frank now; and to Bob
as well. The latter had not been able to say a
word while this interesting conversation was going
on between his chum and the leader of the
gold thieves. But now that the story had all been
told, Bob began to “get back to earth” again.</p>

<p>“Well, if that don’t beat everything!” he exclaimed.
“Just to think, Frank, we actually
saved Jared Scott, when his balloon was running
away from him, after something happened to
make it unmanageable. But Frank, I looked in
the broken basket, and there wasn’t a single bag
of ballast, or anything else there!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Frank, with a broad smile beginning
to cover his boyish face; “because Mr.
Jared Scott had been compelled to heave the three
bags of gold overboard, one at a time, perhaps,
to try and lighten his falling air craft, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
threatening to dump him out on the ground from
loss of gas!”</p>

<p>“Frank, do you really believe that?” cried
Bob.</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” answered the other, who knew
it could not be otherwise.</p>

<p>“He dropped the gold ballast to save his life;
but, Frank, do you think a man like Jared Scott
would ever want to lose track of such a prize?”
Bob went on.</p>

<p>“Make your mind easy on that score,” broke
in Reddy, who had been listening to this talk.
“Jared always had an eye to the main chance; an’
even if his life was hanging by a thread, he’d
never throw a bag of the real stuff overboard, but
what he’d mark the spot where it fell!”</p>

<p>Bob Archer’s excitement grew stronger than
ever. He caught hold of his chum by the arm,
and Frank could see how the Kentucky boy was
trembling.</p>

<p>“Frank, what about that packet he gave you?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve got it safe still; and here it is,” replied
the other, as he ran one hand inside his
jacket, and produced the envelope into which
Jared Scott had slipped the paper on which he
had written something, at the time he was leaving
them to seek the services of a doctor down the

<p>“Frank, we saved his life, he said!” Bob continued.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we did; and again he might have got
out of that pickle without any help from us. It
was a toss-up,” Frank replied, smiling at his
chum’s eagerness.</p>

<p>“But just then he was feeling mighty grateful
to us, Frank. I saw how he started, and looked
at you, when he heard your name. And I
wouldn’t be one bit surprised if what he wrote
down on that paper turned out to be directions,
telling us where to locate the three stolen bags
of gold!”</p>

<p>“It may be you are right, Bob,” Frank said,
thoughtfully, as he looked at the packet in his
hand; “but you remember I gave him my solemn
promise that I wouldn’t open this envelope until
seven days had passed; and there’s some time yet
before then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>you</em> promised him,” said Bob, “but <em>I</em>
didn’t say a word!”</p>

<p>With that he snatched the envelope from the
hand of his chum, and tore the end off, as
though he feared that Frank might try and stop
him. But Frank evidently had no such intention
just then. Perhaps he realized how conditions
had arisen that changed the complexion of things
very much. Jared Scott, an honest aeronaut, and
Jared Scott, the accomplice of the gold thieves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
were two different persons. And a promise made
under such deception might not hold.</p>

<p>Bob was eagerly reading what the man had
written. To do this he had to bend down to the
lantern. Frank, and all the others in the room,
watched him intently, eager to know the import
of the message.</p>

<p>When Bob finished the short contents of Jared
Scott’s mysterious note, he leaped up, and clutched
Frank’s hands.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Frank!” he exclaimed. “Just
what I said, he wanted us to recover the treasure,
because he feared he’d never get over his injuries.
And he’s set it all down here in black and white,
just where he dropped each bag when almost
touching the earth. We can’t help but find ’em,
Frank! Whoop! what luck! I feel like I could
screech like a Navajo Indian in the war dance,”
and Bob did actually start to hop around the
shack, as though unable to control himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br>
<span class="fs80">HOW IT TURNED OUT—CONCLUSION</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Let me look at what he wrote, since you’ve
chosen to break the seal,” said Frank, holding out
his hand, into which his chum placed the page
torn from the memorandum book of Jared Scott.</p>

<p>The man had indeed carefully noted just where
he dropped each sack, when compelled to lose
them. One would be found at the foot of three
cedars, that stood out by themselves in a certain
place he described; a second in a little gully that
crossed an open stretch of ground, where two
trails came together; while the third, and last,
had been tossed out on the summit of the range
where the basket had collided with the rocks.</p>

<p>Frank saw that the directions were so clear
that they would not have a great deal of trouble
in locating the three bags. If they had burst by
coming in contact with the ground their heavy
contents would still lie in a heap, and could be
easily gathered up.</p>

<p>“Why do you think he set the time at seven
days, Frank?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“Hum! well, now that’s a question,” remarked
his chum. “If I knew Mr. Jared Scott better,
I might be able to hit the truth, first shot. It
may be he wanted more time to get away himself.
Then again, perhaps he expected to know how he
was going to come out with the doctor; and hoped
for one last chance to get back here himself, to
gather up his scattered sacks.”</p>

<p>“That last guess sounds more like Jared,” remarked
Reddy, bitterly. “He wouldn’t give up
anything, if he saw any chance to keep a grip on
it. But if it turned out that he had to ‘cash in,’
why then he might be willin’ for ye to get the stuff
back again.”</p>

<p>“We’re all pretty well played out just now,”
said Frank, after a pause.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” put in Bob.</p>

<p>“And nothing ought to be done till morning,
when we can return to the mine with our prisoners.
When we’ve got them off our hands, we’ll
turn our attention to the job of finding the treasure.
How does that suit you, Bob and Mr.
Riley?” went on Frank.</p>

<p>Both of them declared that they were fully
satisfied.</p>

<p>“Only we’ve got to make sure that none of
these slippery customers gives us the go-by during
the balance of the night,” added the ex-mine superintendent,
scowling in the direction of Reddy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
Blaisdell and the two men whose names they did
not as yet know.</p>

<p>“We’ll hunt up some rope, and make them
safe,” Frank declared; and after an examination
of the contents of the two bags, what they sought
came to light in the shape of a heavy and strong
line.</p>

<p>So the four men were compelled to submit to
having their legs, as well as their arms, bound.
And after Mr. Riley got through with them there
was small chance for any one of them to escape.</p>

<p>After that the tired boys found the best place
possible in which to lie down. Bob must have
been asleep within three minutes after his head
touched the bag he was using for a pillow; and he
knew nothing more until some one shook him,
calling out that it was morning.</p>

<p>“Why, I just slept like a log,” declared Bob.
“Never knew a thing all night. My! but I must
have been pretty near all in, that time. How’s
everything, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be finer; and a good morning to start
back to the mine,” remarked his chum, who had a
fire started on the hearth, and some of the contents
of the two bags cooking for breakfast.</p>

<p>“Say, we’re lucky again, in finding all that
grub, just when we were near the starvation
stage,” remarked Bob, as he sniffed the odor of
coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>The four men were just where Bob had last
seen them at the time he lay down. All declared
themselves stiff and sore, particularly those who
had been hurt in the excitement that had marked
the previous night.</p>

<p>“I’m cooking plenty of breakfast for the
crowd,” Frank had announced aloud, as he saw
the way in which the men would follow him
around with their hungry eyes; “and one by one
you fellows will be untied and fed; but after that
your arms must be fastened again. We don’t
trust one of you any further than we can see
you.”</p>

<p>In good season they left the lone shack on the
hillside, and headed down toward the spot where
the two saddle boys, as well as Mr. Riley, expected
to find their horses browsing.</p>

<p>Reddy had told where the pair they had ridden
could be found. The men were fastened to the
backs of these animals, which were to be led, as
the little caravan took up the journey for distant
Cherry Blossom mine.</p>

<p>“How long did it take us to get here?” asked
Bob, after they had fairly started, Domino,
Buckskin and the bay having been found readily
enough below.</p>

<p>“More than three hours in all; but we’re going
to be twice that getting back,” replied Mr.
Riley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Why is that so?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Because, you see we don’t expect to try and
make speed, as we did coming.”</p>

<p>“Well, we couldn’t, with these fellows tied up
the way they are. A walk, or at best, a slow trot,
is the limit with them,” and Frank pointed to the
prisoners who sat grimly, two upon each spare
horse.</p>

<p>“And then again, not wantin’ to try and pass
on that narrow ledge, I’ve got to lead around another
way, that’s longer, but safer. Perhaps we
might make the mine a short time after noon, if
all goes well,” concluded Mr. Riley.</p>

<p>On the way they happened to pass close to one
of the points referred to in the brief note of instructions
left in their charge by Jared Scott.
Frank, desirous of proving the truth of the directions
which had been placed in his hand by the
balloonist, took occasion to make a thorough
search.</p>

<p>And sure enough, he came upon the sack at
the foot of the three cedars. It had burst under
the heavy impact with the ground; but it was a
comparatively easy matter to gather up the precious
contents, so that there was practically no
loss whatever.</p>

<p>“This looks as if we were going to get it all
back!” remarked Mr. Riley, stopping to notice
the look of yearning that appeared on the faces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
of the prisoners, as they feasted their eyes on the
treasure sack.</p>

<p>It did take them fully six hours to reach the
mine, and all of them were glad when the journey
came at last to an end, particularly the bound
men.</p>

<p>Everything was found to be moving finely at
the Cherry Blossom. Sandy McCoy knew just
how to manage things; for the fact of his having
been an engineer aboard ship was in his favor
when handling machinery.</p>

<p>Of course things had to be closed down for a
short season after their arrival. The men were
wild with excitement, for in some way the story
of the robbery had leaked out. And when it was
known that not only had two of the thieves been
captured, but there was a very good chance for recovering
all of the gold, hearty cheers announced
that the late unpleasantness was already forgotten,
and that from henceforth they were all in
full sympathy with the company working the
Cherry Blossom mine.</p>

<p>Of course the boys believed that the series of
strange things that had come to pass since they
left Circle Ranch, to make the long journey to
the mine, were never to be equalled in all their
experience. But when deciding thus they could
not foresee certain events that were destined soon
to come about. These will be related in the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
volume of this series, to be called: “The Saddle
Boys at Circle Ranch; or, In at the Grand
Round-Up.”</p>

<p>Before returning to his ranch home, Frank
spent three days in company with his chum, Mr.
Riley, and Sim Garrison, searching for the other
two missing treasure sacks. It proved that Jared
Scott had very carefully noted where they had
dropped. And, following out the plain directions
which he had jotted down, they eventually found
them both.</p>

<p>Thus the strike was settled; the treasure, stolen
from the strong room, recovered; and all those
who participated in the robbery caught, with the
exception of Jared Scott.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards Frank tried to find him,
but learned he had, with some friends, hurried
away from the town on the river a few days after
arriving there, regardless of his broken limb.
Whether he really went up into the mountains in
the hope of locating the treasure himself, regretting
his act of giving its hiding place away, or simply
vanished because he feared arrest, was never
known.</p>

<p>Reddy and Blaisdell were tried for the crime,
and received their sentence. Taking off time for
possible good behavior they would have to serve
some ten years.</p>

<p>The other two men managed to escape. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
had not been in the league to begin with, nor had
either of them touched the real treasure sacks
at any time; though their intentions could not be
doubted.</p>

<p>When the time came for the saddle boys to
make the return journey Mr. Riley accompanied
them. And he promised that if their story of what
had happened during their absence from the ranch
failed in covering the ground, he would have a
few things to add to it, such as the Colonel would
be glad to hear.</p>

<p>Bob had made sure to secure the skin of the
panther which had fallen to his gun on that occasion
when the big cat attacked him for shooting
the deer he had apparently selected for his own
dinner.</p>

<p>“I don’t care particularly about running across
another of the same sort in a hurry,” he remarked,
after he found that the skin was in good condition,
the dry air having acted as a preservative; “and
it seems to strike me this will make a pretty good
mat.”</p>

<p>Nothing came to pass on the home trip that
was out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>“Which shows how things will sometimes
crowd a fellow,” remarked Frank, as his chum
was running off the list of adventures that had
come to them, and using about all his fingers to
keep tally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Haywood was very much pleased with
the way in which the two lads had conducted matters.
He often declared that had he been able
to make the trip himself he could not have done
better, and possibly might have fallen short of
the success that had followed their efforts.</p>

<p>Mr. Riley was installed in his new job, and
soon declared he was glad the change had come
about. The life of the range suited him better
than that of the mine.</p>

<p>One day a gentleman came to Circle Ranch and
asked to see Frank. It turned out that he was a
Professor Wadleigh, the real owner of the balloon
that Jared Scott had stolen when he conceived
the idea of hoodwinking his two fellow
schemers, who were planning to rob the Cherry
Blossom mine.</p>

<p>The professor had learned in some way that
Frank knew about his lost balloon, and hence had
come to see if there was any chance for recovering
it, as the silk of which it was made was valuable.</p>

<p>Of course Frank gave him minute directions as
to where the balloon had lain at last accounts; and
the professor went off with the intention of hiring
several guides, and making the attempt at recovering
his property.</p>

<p>Whether he succeeded or not Frank never
knew. But often he and Bob would recall the
exciting happenings that marked their journey to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
the mine; and among these one that must always
stand out with particular vividness was the occasion
when they saw Jared Scott hanging from the
wrecked balloon; and Frank snubbed the flight of
the runaway gas-bag by whipping the anchor rope
around a tree trunk.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
